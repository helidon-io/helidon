/**
 * Abstraction of processing around an interception point, independent from the details of any
 * particular interceptor or the specific type of work done (e.g., updating metrics) before the intercepted invocation runs and
 * after it completes.
 * <p>
 *     To use {@code InterceptionRunner}, clients:
 *     <ul>
 *         <li>Create an instance of a class which implements {@code InterceptionRunner}.</li>
 *         <li>From the interceptor's {@code @AroundConstruct} and {@code @AroundInvoke} methods, invoke one of the variants of
 *         the runner's {@link #run(InvocationContext, Iterable, PreInvocationHandler) run} method. Which variant depends on whether the
 *         specific interceptor needs to operate on the work items
 *         <ul>
 *             <li>only before (e.g., to increment a counter metric), or</li>
 *             <li>both
 *         before and after (e.g., to update a metric that measures time spent in the intercepted method)</li>
 *         </ul>
 *         the intercepted
 *         method
 *         runs.
 *         <p>
 *             The interceptor passes the {@code run} method:
 *             <ul>
 *                <li>the {@code InvocationContext} for the executable being intercepted,</li>
 *                <li>an {@code Iterable<>} of the work items,</li>
 *                <li>a pre-invocation {@code Consumer} of work item which performs an action on each work item before the
 *                intercepted invocation runs, and</li>
 *                <li>an post-completion {@code Consumer} of work item which performs an action on each work item after the
 *                intercepted invocation has finished, only for the "before-and-after"
 *                {@link #run(InvocationContext, Iterable, PreInvocationHandler, PostCompletionHandler) run} variant.</li>
 *             </ul>
 *         </li>
 *     </ul>
 * <p>
 *      The runner
 *      <ol>
 *          <li>invokes the pre-invocation consumer for all work items,</li>
 *          <li>invokes the intercepted executable, then</li>
 *          <li>(if provided) invokes the post-completion consumer for all work
 *          items.</li>
 *      </ol>
 * <p>
 *     The interface requires an {@code Iterable<>} for work items because, in the before-and-after case, the runner
 *     might need to process the work items twice. In those cases, the {@code Iterable} can furnish two {@code Iterator}s.
