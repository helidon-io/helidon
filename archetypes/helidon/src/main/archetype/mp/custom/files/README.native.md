Make sure you have GraalVM locally installed:

```
$GRAALVM_HOME/bin/native-image --version
```

Build the native image using the native image profile:

```
mvn package -Pnative-image
```

This uses the helidon-maven-plugin to perform the native compilation using your installed copy of GraalVM. It might take a while to complete.
Once it completes start the application using the native executable (no JVM!):

```
./target/{{artifactId}}
```

Yep, it starts fast. You can exercise the applicationâ€™s endpoints as before.
