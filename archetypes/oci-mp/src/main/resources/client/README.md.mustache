# Helidon-Pegasus Client using MP

This module demonstrates how to generate a Helidon Microprofile restful microservice-based client, using OpenApi tool, that communicates with a Helidon MP service endpoint.

1. Client-side source code that will be generated using OpenApi tool based on an OpenApi specification document in the form 
of [api.yaml](../spec/api.yaml) as an input. The generated source code will be located in 
[target/generated-sources/client/src/main/java/{{package}}/client](target/generated-sources/client/src/main/java/{{package}}/client)
and will have the following components:
   * A microprofile rest client interface (that will automatically be registered with CDI). Please check out 
     [Microprofile Rest Client](https://helidon.io/docs/v2/#/mp/restclient/09_rest-client) for more
     information about this concept.
   * A Json-based request/response model.
2. The generated microProfile rest client interface called [GreetApi.java](target/generated-sources/client/src/main/java/{{package}}/client/api/GreetApi)
then can be injected using `@RestClient` or initialized using `RestClientBuilder` by end user application along with generated model classes for the request/response.

## Generator Configuration:
The generator configuration can be customized in [pom.xml](pom.xml). See [documentation](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators/java) for detailed information on each option.

## System Requirements:
1. JDK 11+ 
2. mvn 3.8.3+
3. Helidon 2.5.4

## Build 
Just run: 
```bash
mvn clean install
``` 

## Distribution
As part of the [build](#build), a zip file in 
[target/{{artifactId}}-client-distribution.zip](target/{{artifactId}}-client-distribution.zip)
will be created that can be used to distribute/deploy to other machines such as an OCI VM instance. This zip file can be 
securely copied over by tools like `scp (secure copy)` to another machine's directory and unzipped.
1. Upload to a remote machine using scp
   ```bash
   $ scp target/{{artifactId}}-client-distribution.zip user@DESTINATION_HOST:/home/user
   ```
2. Unzip (will extract to `{{artifactId}}-client` directory) and run
   ```bash
   $ unzip {{artifactId}}-client-distribution.zip
   ```
