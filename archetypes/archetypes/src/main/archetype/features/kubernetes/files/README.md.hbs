## Run the application in Kubernetes

If you don’t have access to a Kubernetes cluster, you can [install one](https://helidon.io/docs/latest/#/about/kubernetes) on your desktop.

### Verify connectivity to cluster

```shell
kubectl cluster-info                        # Verify which cluster
kubectl get pods                            # Verify connectivity to cluster
```

{{#first}}

{{/first}}
{{.}}
{{/k8s-readme-sections}}

### Deploy the application to Kubernetes

```shell
kubectl create -f app.yaml                              # Deploy application
kubectl get pods                                        # Wait for quickstart pod to be RUNNING
kubectl get service  {{artifactId}}                     # Get service info
kubectl port-forward service/{{artifactId}} 8081:8080   # Forward service port to 8081
```

You can now exercise the application as you did before but use the port number 8081.

After you’re done, cleanup.

```shell
kubectl delete -f app.yaml
```
