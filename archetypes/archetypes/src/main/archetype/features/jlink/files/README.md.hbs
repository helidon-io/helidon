## Building a Custom Runtime Image

Build the custom runtime image using the jlink image profile:

```shell
mvn package -Pjlink-image
```

This uses the helidon-maven-plugin to perform the custom image generation.
After the build completes it will report some statistics about the build including the reduction in image size.

The target/{{artifactId}}-jri directory is a self-contained custom image of your application. It contains your application,
its runtime dependencies and the JDK modules it depends on. You can start your application using the provide start script:

```shell
./target/{{artifactId}}-jri/bin/start
```

Class Data Sharing (CDS) Archive
Also included in the custom image is a Class Data Sharing (CDS) archive that improves your application’s startup
performance and in-memory footprint. You can learn more about Class Data Sharing in the JDK documentation.

The CDS archive increases your image size to get these performance optimizations. It can be of significant size (tens of MB).
The size of the CDS archive is reported at the end of the build output.

If you’d rather have a smaller image size (with a slightly increased startup time) you can skip the creation of the CDS
archive by executing your build like this:

```shell
mvn package -Pjlink-image -Djlink.image.addClassDataSharingArchive=false
```

For more information on available configuration options see the helidon-maven-plugin documentation.
