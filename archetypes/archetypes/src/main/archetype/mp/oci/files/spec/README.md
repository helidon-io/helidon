# OpenAPI Specification Document

This module contains an [OpenApi v3 specification](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.0) document in the form of
[api.yaml](api.yaml) that will be used by both the [server](../server/README.md)
and [client](../client/README.md) modules to generate Server API and Client code, respectively.
