## Exercise Webclient

First, start the server:

```
java -jar target/{{artifactId}}.jar
```

Note the port number that it displays. For example:

```
WEB server is up! http://localhost:8080/simple-greet
```

Then run the client, passing the port number. It will connect
to the server:

```
java -cp "target/classes:target/libs/*" {{package}}.WebClientMain PORT
```
