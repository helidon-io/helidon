## Try health

This example shows the basics of using Helidon SE Health. It uses the
set of built-in health checks that Helidon provides plus defines a
custom health check.

Note the port number reported by the application.

Probe the health endpoints:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/observe/health
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/observe/health/ready
```
