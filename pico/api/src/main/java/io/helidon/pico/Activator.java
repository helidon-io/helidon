/**
 * Activators are responsible for lifecycle creation and lazy activation of service providers. They are responsible for taking the
 * {@link ServiceProvider}'s manage service instance from {@link Phase#PENDING}
 * through {@link Phase#POST_CONSTRUCTING} (i.e., including any
 * {@link PostConstructMethod} invocations, etc.), and finally into the
 * {@link Phase#ACTIVE} phase.
 * <p>
 * Assumption:
 * <ol>
 *  <li>Each {@link ServiceProvider} managing its backing service will have an activator strategy conforming to the DI
 *  specification.</li>
 *  <li>Each services activation is expected to be non-blocking, but may in fact require deferred blocking activities to become
 *  fully ready for runtime operation.</li>
 * </ol>
 * Activation includes:
 * <ol>
 *  <li>Management of the service's {@link Phase}.</li>
 *  <li>Control over creation (i.e., invoke the constructor non-reflectively).</li>
 *  <li>Control over gathering the service requisite dependencies (ctor, field, setters) and optional activation of those.</li>
 *  <li>Invocation of any {@link PostConstructMethod}.</li>
 *  <li>Responsible to logging to the {@link ActivationLog} - see {@link PicoServices#activationLog()}.</li>
