/**
 * The Contract annotation is used to relay significance to the type. While remaining optional in its use, it is typically placed
 * on an interface definition to signify that the given type can be used for lookup in the service registry, or otherwise be
 * eligible for injection via standard @Inject. It could also be used on other types (e.g., abstract class) as well.
 * <p>
 *
 * If the developer does not have access to the source to place this annotation on the interface definition then consider using
 * {@link ExternalContracts} instead - this annotation can be placed on the implementation class implementing the given interface.
 * See io.helidon.pico.spi.ServiceInfo#getContractsImplemented()
