/**
 * The {@code Contract} annotation is used to relay significance to the type that it annotates. While remaining optional in its
 * use, it is typically placed on an interface definition to signify that the given type can be used for lookup in the
 * {@link io.helidon.pico.Services} registry, and be eligible for injection via standard {@code @Inject}.
 * While normally placed on interface types, it can also be placed on abstract and concrete class as well. The main point is that
 * a {@code Contract} is the focal point for service lookup and injection.
 * <p>
 * If the developer does not have access to the source to place this annotation on the interface definition directly then consider
 * using {@link ExternalContracts} instead - this annotation can be placed on the implementation class implementing the given
 * {@code Contract} interface(s).
