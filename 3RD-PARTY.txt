worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
meet the following conditions:

of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
as modifying the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade

Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the

unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

The complete text of the Eclipse Public License is as follows:

 Eclipse Public License - v 1.0

 THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
 PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
 OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

 1. DEFINITIONS

 "Contribution" means:

 a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
 documentation distributed under this Agreement, and

 b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

 i) changes to the Program, and

 ii) additions to the Program;
 where such changes and/or additions to the Program
 originate from and are distributed by that particular
 Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a
 Contributor if it was added to the Program by such
 Contributor itself or anyone acting on such
 Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include
 additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules
 of software distributed in conjunction with the Program
 under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not
 derivative works of the Program.

 "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

 "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor
 which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its
 Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.

 "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with
 this Agreement.

 "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this
 Agreement, including all Contributors.

 2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

 a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor
 hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,
 royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare
 derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
 distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
 Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source
 code and object code form.

 b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor
 hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,
 royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make,
 use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the
 Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and
 object code form. This patent license shall apply to the
 combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the
 time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
 addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be
 covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not
 apply to any other combinations which include the
 Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.

 c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants
 the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no
 assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program
 does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property
 rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any
 liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity
 based on infringement of intellectual property rights or
 otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and
 licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes
 sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property
 rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent
 license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the
 Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that
 license before distributing the Program.

 d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
 sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to
 grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

 3. REQUIREMENTS

 A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code
 form under its own license agreement, provided that:

 a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

 b) its license agreement:

 i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all
 warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
 warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement,
 and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability
 and fitness for a particular purpose;

 ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all
 liability for damages, including direct, indirect,
 special, incidental and consequential damages, such as
 lost profits;

 iii) states that any provisions which differ from this
 Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not
 by any other party; and

 iv) states that source code for the Program is available
 from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to
 obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium
 customarily used for software exchange.

 When the Program is made available in source code form:

 a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

 b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
 the Program.

 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
 within the Program.

 Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
 Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
 Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

 4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

 Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
 responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and
 the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the
 commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the
 Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
 which does not create potential liability for other Contributors.
 Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial
 product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby
 agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified
 Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively
 "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions
 brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
 extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial
 Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a
 commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
 apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
 intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an
 Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
 Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial
 Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial
 Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations.
 The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its
 own expense.

 For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
 product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
 Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
 claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
 claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's
 responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor
 would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related
 to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires
 any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
 Contributor must pay those damages.

 5. NO WARRANTY

 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS
 PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
 ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
 ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
 MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient
 is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using
 and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with
 its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not
 limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with
 applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment,
 and unavailability or interruption of operations.

 6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT
 NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
 INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
 (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON
 ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR
 TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF
 THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
 GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
 DAMAGES.

 7. GENERAL

 If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
 applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability
 of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
 action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to
 the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
 enforceable.

 If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
 (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
 the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other
 software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then
 such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate
 as of the date such litigation is filed.

 All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
 fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
 Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
 time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
 rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
 and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
 However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any
 licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue
 and survive.

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this
 Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is
 copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The
 Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions
 (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one
 other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this
 Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward.
 The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the
 Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of
 the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The
 Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject
 to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In
 addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
 Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its
 Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in
 Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or
 licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this
 Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise.
 All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement
 are reserved.

 This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and
 the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No
 party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this
 Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each
 party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

The complete text of the Common Public License is as follows:

 Common Public License - v 1.0

 THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON
 PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF
 THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

 1. DEFINITIONS

 "Contribution" means:

 a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
 documentation distributed under this Agreement, and

 b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

 i) changes to the Program, and

 ii) additions to the Program;

 where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate
 from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A
 Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the
 Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such
 Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the
 Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
 conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement,
 and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.

 "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

 "Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor
 which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution
 alone or when combined with the Program.

 "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

 "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this
 Agreement, including all Contributors.

 2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

 a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor
 hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
 copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly
 display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution
 of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code
 and object code form.

 b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor
 hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
 patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to
 sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such
 Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent
 license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
 Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor,
 such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be
 covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to
 any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per
 se is licensed hereunder.

 c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants
 the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
 provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
 patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each
 Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by
 any other entity based on infringemen

"reactive-streams" 1.0.1 (org.reactivestreams:reactive-streams)
To the extent possible under law, the person who associated CC0 with this
code has waived all copyright and related or neighboring rights to this code.

Statement of Purpose The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world
automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon
the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original
work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works
("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and
redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,
including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to
the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of
creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater
distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of
additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work
(the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and
Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and
publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related
Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the
following:

the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and
translate a Work; moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or
performer(s); publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
likeness depicted in a Work; rights protecting against unfair competition in
regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below; rights
protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;
database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of
databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended
or successor version of such directive); and other similar, equivalent or
corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and
any national implementations thereof. 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent
permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby
overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons,
and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated
claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as
well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty
(including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and
for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver").
Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large
and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that
such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,
termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express
Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver
is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non
transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional
license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in
all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable
law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes
(the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason
be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial
invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License,
and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise
any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)
assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in
either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document. Affirmer offers
the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning
the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation
warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the
present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest
extent permissible under applicable law. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for
clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof,
including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the
Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work. Affirmer
understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this
document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the
Work.

Dedicator makes this dedication for the benefit of the public at large and to
the detriment of the Dedicator's heirs and successors. Dedicator intends this
dedication to be an overt act of relinquishment in perpetuity of all present
and future rights under copyright law, whether vested or contingent, in the
Work. Dedicator understands that such relinquishment of all rights includes
the relinquishment of all rights to enforce (by lawsuit or otherwise) those
copyrights in the Work.

Dedicator recognizes that, once placed in the public domain, the Work may be
freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, used, modified, built upon, or
otherwise exploited by anyone for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial,
and in any way, including by methods that have not yet been invented or
conceived.

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2.1, February 1999 
Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document,
but changing it is not allowed. 

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts as the
successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and 
change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee 
your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free 
for all its users. 
This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially 
designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation 
and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first 
think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is 
the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below. 
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our 
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to 
distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that 
you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the 
software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that 
you can do these things. 
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to 
deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions 
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the 
library or if you modify it. 
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, 
you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure 
that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the 
library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can 
relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. 
And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. 
We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) 
we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute 
and/or modify the library. 
To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty 
for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed 
on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so 
that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be 
introduced by others. 
Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free 
program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users 
of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. 
Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library 
must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license. 
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General 
Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to 
certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General 
Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking 
those libraries into non-free programs. 
When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared 
library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a 
derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore 
permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. 
The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code 
with the library. 
We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to 
protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also 
provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free 
programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public 
License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in 
certain special circumstances. 
For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest 
possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To 
achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent 
case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In 
this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software 
only, so we use the Lesser General Public License. 
In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables 
a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, 
permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to 
use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating 
system. 
Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, 
it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the 
freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the 
Library. 
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. 
Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the library" and a 
"work that uses the library". The former contains code derived from the library, 
whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run. 

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 0.

This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which 
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it 
may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also 
called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you". 
A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to 
be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions 
and data) to form executables. 
The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been 
distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the 
Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work 
containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications 
and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation 
is included without limitation in the term "modification".) 
"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making 
modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code 
for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus 
the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library. 
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this 
License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library 
is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents 
constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a 
tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what 
the program that uses the Library does. 
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code 
as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately 
publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; 
keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any 
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library. 
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at 
your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus 
forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or 
work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these 
conditions: 
a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you 
changed the files and the date of any change.
c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third 
parties under the terms of this License.
d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to 
be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an 
argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort 
to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, 
the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains 
meaningful. (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is 
entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d 
requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must 
be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must 
still compute square roots.) 
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections 
of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered 
independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do 
not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you 
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the 
Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose 
permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and 
every part regardless of who wrote it. Thus, it is not the intent of this section
to claim rights or contest your rights to 
work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control 
the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library. 
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the 
Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or 
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. 
3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead 
of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the 
notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General 
Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than 
version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can 
specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these 
notices. 
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the 
ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative 
works made from that copy. 
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a 
program that is not a library. 
4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under 
Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 
above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine- 
readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 
above on a medium customarily used for software interchange. 
If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated 
place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place 
satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties 
are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code. 
5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is 
designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a 
"work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of 
the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License. 
However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an 
executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the 
Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is therefore 
covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such 
executables. 
When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of 
the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library 
even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant 
if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. 
The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law. 
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and 
accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in 
length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it 
is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions 
of the Library will still fall under Section 6.) 
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object 
code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work 
also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library 
itself. 
6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work that 
uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the 
Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the 
terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse 
engineering for debugging such modifications. 
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used 
in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply 
a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you 
must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference 
directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these 
things: 
a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code 
for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be 
distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked 
with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library", 
as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then 
relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is 
understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the 
Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the 
modified definitions.)
b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable 
mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on 
the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the 
executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if 
the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with 
the version that the work was made with.
c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give 
the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more 
than the cost of performing this distribution.
d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated 
place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same 
place.
e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you 
have already sent this user a copy. For an executable, the required form of the "work
that uses the Library" must 
include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. 
However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include 
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the 
major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the 
executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. 
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other 
proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a 
contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an 
executable that you distribute. 
7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by- 
side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this 
License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate 
distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is 
otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things: 
a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library,
uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the
terms of the Sections above.
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a
work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined
form of the same work. 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library
is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License
will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 
9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library
or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not
accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any
work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so,
and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library
or works based on it. 
10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library),
the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy,
distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions.
You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the
rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third
parties with this License. 
11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement
or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed
on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the
conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations
under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not
permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies
directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it
and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library. 
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. 
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people
have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is
up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software
through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. This section
is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of
the rest of this License. 
12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright
holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit
geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such
case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
this License. 
13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns. 
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies
a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version",
you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that
version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.
If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any
version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 
14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs
whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author
to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving
the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the
sharing and reuse of software generally. 
NO WARRANTY 
15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE 
LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN 
WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" 
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT 
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR 
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH 
YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY 
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 
16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY 
COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY 
AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, 
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE 
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE 
OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE 
WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries If you
develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the
public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and
change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or,
alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License). 
To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the
exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and
a pointer to where the full notice is found. one line to give the library's name
and an idea of what it does. Copyright (C) year name of author 
This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the
terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software
Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version. 
This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY
WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Lesser General Public License for more details. 
You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License along
with this library; if not, write to the
Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. 
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if necessary. Here is
a sample; alter the names: 
Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the library `Frob'
(a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

Eclipse Public License - v 1.0
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation
distributed under this Agreement, and

b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

i) changes to the Program, and

ii) additions to the Program;

where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and
are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates'
from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor
itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do
not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of
software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own
license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.

"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
or when combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any,
and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.

b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under
Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise
transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and
object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of
the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added
by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such
combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license
shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution.
No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.

c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses
to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other
intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor
disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other
entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise.
As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder,
each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other
intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program,
it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.

d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form
under its own license agreement, provided that:

a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

b) its license agreement:

i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of
title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of
merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;

ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages,
such as lost profits;

iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered
by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor,
and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through
a medium customarily used for software exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:

a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any,
in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor
who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a
manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors.
Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product
offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend
and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any
losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial
Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial
product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims
or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.
In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the
Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial
Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in,
the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor
may participate in any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If
that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such
Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial
Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related
to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other
Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must
pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each
Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using
and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise
of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and
costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss
of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION
LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY
OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself
(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes
such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b)
shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does
not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of
such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement
and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue
and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may
only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves
the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement
from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right
to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement
Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as
the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of
the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program
(including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version
of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new
version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute
the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as
expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights
or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this
Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All
rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to
this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than
one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights
to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.
