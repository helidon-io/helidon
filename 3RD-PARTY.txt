worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
meet the following conditions:

of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
as modifying the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade

Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the

unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

The complete text of the Eclipse Public License is as follows:

 Eclipse Public License - v 1.0

 THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
 PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
 OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

 1. DEFINITIONS

 "Contribution" means:

 a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
 documentation distributed under this Agreement, and

 b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

 i) changes to the Program, and

 ii) additions to the Program;
 where such changes and/or additions to the Program
 originate from and are distributed by that particular
 Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a
 Contributor if it was added to the Program by such
 Contributor itself or anyone acting on such
 Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include
 additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules
 of software distributed in conjunction with the Program
 under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not
 derivative works of the Program.

 "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

 "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor
 which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its
 Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.

 "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with
 this Agreement.

 "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this
 Agreement, including all Contributors.

 2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

 a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor
 hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,
 royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare
 derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
 distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
 Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source
 code and object code form.

 b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor
 hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,
 royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make,
 use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the
 Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and
 object code form. This patent license shall apply to the
 combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the
 time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
 addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be
 covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not
 apply to any other combinations which include the
 Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.

 c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants
 the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no
 assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program
 does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property
 rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any
 liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity
 based on infringement of intellectual property rights or
 otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and
 licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes
 sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property
 rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent
 license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the
 Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that
 license before distributing the Program.

 d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
 sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to
 grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

 3. REQUIREMENTS

 A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code
 form under its own license agreement, provided that:

 a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

 b) its license agreement:

 i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all
 warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
 warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement,
 and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability
 and fitness for a particular purpose;

 ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all
 liability for damages, including direct, indirect,
 special, incidental and consequential damages, such as
 lost profits;

 iii) states that any provisions which differ from this
 Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not
 by any other party; and

 iv) states that source code for the Program is available
 from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to
 obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium
 customarily used for software exchange.

 When the Program is made available in source code form:

 a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

 b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
 the Program.

 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
 within the Program.

 Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
 Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
 Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

 4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

 Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
 responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and
 the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the
 commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the
 Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
 which does not create potential liability for other Contributors.
 Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial
 product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby
 agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified
 Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively
 "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions
 brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
 extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial
 Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a
 commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
 apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
 intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an
 Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
 Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial
 Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial
 Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations.
 The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its
 own expense.

 For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
 product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
 Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
 claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
 claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's
 responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor
 would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related
 to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires
 any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
 Contributor must pay those damages.

 5. NO WARRANTY

 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS
 PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
 ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
 ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
 MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient
 is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using
 and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with
 its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not
 limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with
 applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment,
 and unavailability or interruption of operations.

 6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT
 NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
 INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
 (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON
 ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR
 TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF
 THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
 GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
 DAMAGES.

 7. GENERAL

 If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
 applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability
 of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
 action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to
 the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
 enforceable.

 If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
 (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
 the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other
 software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then
 such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate
 as of the date such litigation is filed.

 All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
 fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
 Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
 time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
 rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
 and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
 However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any
 licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue
 and survive.

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this
 Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is
 copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The
 Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions
 (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one
 other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this
 Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward.
 The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the
 Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of
 the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The
 Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject
 to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In
 addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
 Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its
 Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in
 Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or
 licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this
 Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise.
 All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement
 are reserved.

 This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and
 the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No
 party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this
 Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each
 party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

The complete text of the Common Public License is as follows:

 Common Public License - v 1.0

 THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON
 PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF
 THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

 1. DEFINITIONS

 "Contribution" means:

 a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
 documentation distributed under this Agreement, and

 b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

 i) changes to the Program, and

 ii) additions to the Program;

 where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate
 from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A
 Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the
 Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such
 Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the
 Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
 conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement,
 and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.

 "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

 "Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor
 which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution
 alone or when combined with the Program.

 "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

 "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this
 Agreement, including all Contributors.

 2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

 a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor
 hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
 copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly
 display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution
 of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code
 and object code form.

 b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor
 hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
 patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to
 sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such
 Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent
 license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
 Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor,
 such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be
 covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to
 any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per
 se is licensed hereunder.

 c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants
 the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
 provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
 patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each
 Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by
 any other entity based on infringemen

"reactive-streams" 1.0.1 (org.reactivestreams:reactive-streams)
To the extent possible under law, the person who associated CC0 with this
code has waived all copyright and related or neighboring rights to this code.

Statement of Purpose The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world
automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon
the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original
work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works
("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and
redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,
including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to
the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of
creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater
distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of
additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work
(the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and
Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and
publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related
Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the
following:

the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and
translate a Work; moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or
performer(s); publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
likeness depicted in a Work; rights protecting against unfair competition in
regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below; rights
protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;
database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of
databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended
or successor version of such directive); and other similar, equivalent or
corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and
any national implementations thereof. 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent
permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby
overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons,
and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated
claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as
well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty
(including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and
for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver").
Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large
and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that
such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,
termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express
Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver
is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non
transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional
license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in
all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable
law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes
(the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason
be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial
invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License,
and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise
any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)
assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in
either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document. Affirmer offers
the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning
the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation
warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the
present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest
extent permissible under applicable law. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for
clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof,
including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the
Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work. Affirmer
understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this
document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the
Work.

his knowledge, the work of authorship identified is in the public domain of
the country from which the work is published, or (b) hereby dedicates whatever

interest he may have in the associated work, and for these purposes, is
described as a "dedicator" below.

A certifier has taken reasonable steps to verify the copyright status of this
work. Certifier recognizes that his good faith efforts may not shield him from

Dedicator makes this dedication for the benefit of the public at large and to
the detriment of the Dedicator's heirs and successors. Dedicator intends this
dedication to be an overt act of relinquishment in perpetuity of all present
and future rights under copyright law, whether vested or contingent, in the
Work. Dedicator understands that such relinquishment of all rights includes
the relinquishment of all rights to enforce (by lawsuit or otherwise) those
copyrights in the Work.

Dedicator recognizes that, once placed in the public domain, the Work may be
freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, used, modified, built upon, or
otherwise exploited by anyone for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial,
and in any way, including by methods that have not yet been invented or
conceived.
