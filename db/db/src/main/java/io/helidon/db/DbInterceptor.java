/**
 * Interceptor to handle work around a database statement.
 * Example of such interceptors: tracing, metrics.
 * <p>
 * Interceptors can be defined as global interceptors, interceptors for a type of a statement and interceptors for a named
 * statement.
 * These are executed in the following order:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>Named interceptors - if there are any interceptors configured for a specific statement, they are executed first</li>
 *     <li>Type interceptors - if there are any interceptors configured for a type of statement, they are executed next</li>
 *     <li>Global interceptors - if there are any interceptors configured globally, they are executed last</li>
 * </ol>
 * Order of interceptors within a group is based on the order they are registered in a builder, or by their priority when
 * loaded from a Java Service loader
