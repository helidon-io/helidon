= The MP RESTful Web Service Guide
:description: Helidon MP guide restful web service
:keywords: helidon, guide, example, mp
:toc: preamble

Create and build a JAX-RS RESTful web service as your first Helidon MP application.

== What you will learn
You'll learn how to use Helidon MP quickly to create a JAX-RS RESTful web service that accepts these HTTP requests:

|===
|Method and URL | Result

|`GET localhost:8080/greet` |Returns a generic but friendly greeting
|`GET localhost:8080/greet/Joe` |Returns a personalized greeting for the specified person
|`PUT localhost:8080/greet/greeting/Hola` |Changes the greeting used in subsequent responses
|===

We create the app in these main steps:

. Write a basic Helidon MP app to respond to the HTTP requests.

. Add code to perform simple health checks.

. Add code to record simple metrics.

This guide walks you through the code and helps you understand what each part of the 
code does as you write the app. But if you prefer, you can get the finished code for this example.
See the <<downloading,downloading>> section for instructions.

== What you need

|===
|About 15 minutes
|An IDE or text editor
|JDK 8 or later
|Maven 3.5 or later
|===

//Optional:
//|===
//|Docker 18.02 (use the Edge channel to run Kubernetes on your desktop)
//|`kubectl` 1.7.4
//|===

== Develop your application

=== Create a new Maven project
You can create your Maven project in these ways:

* use your IDE to create a new Java Maven project, or
* run the standard Maven archetype to create a new Java project using this command:
+
[source,bash]
.Unix-style
----
mvn archetype:generate \
    -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.maven.archetypes \
    -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart \
    -DarchetypeVersion=1.3
----
+
[source,bash]
.Windows-style
----
mvn archetype:generate ^
    -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.maven.archetypes ^
    -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart ^
    -DarchetypeVersion=1.3
----
+
Answer the prompts for your module's group ID, artifact ID, and version,
then `cd` to the `<artifactId>` directory you specified.

=== Update your `pom.xml`
Add the properties and dependencies listed here if they don't exist in your `pom.xml`:
[source,xml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
    <properties>
include::{pom}[tags=helidonVersion;javaVersions]
    </properties>

    <dependencyManagement>
        <dependencies>
include::{pom}[tags=helidonDepMgt;activationDepMgt]
        </dependencies>
    </dependencyManagement>
----
Now you can add Helidon dependencies to your project without having to specify the version.
For this example add these dependencies:
[source,xml]
----
    <dependencies>
include::{pom}[tags=helidonMPBundleDep;gfJsonBDep;jandexDep;activationDep]
    </dependencies>
----
<1> Incorporates the Helidon MicroProfile bundle.
<2> Pulls in JSON-B support.
<3> Adds jandex, a JAX-RS bean search optimizer.
<4> Adds the activation API.

If you run your project from the IDE, the IDE typically handles the main class and places
dependent JARs on the runtime classpath for you and your pom is now ready to go. 

include::{se-guide-adoc}[tag=runMavenOutsideIDE]

=== Create an MP config file
This file contains settings for the Helidon web server and the 
application. Note that the MP Config specification says that 
configuration data is read, by default, from `META-INF/microprofile-config.properties`;
the application does not have to do anything in code to load it.
[source]
.src/main/resources/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties
----
include::{config-file}[tag=configContent]
----
<1> Initial application greeting.
<2> Web server configuration.

=== Create a logging config file
This file controls logging within the application.
[source,java]
.src/main/resources/logging.properties
----
include::{logging-properties-file}[tag=loggingProps]
----

=== Create an "empty" `beans.xml` 
We need to make sure JAX-RS searches for beans. This file accomplishes that.
[source,java]
.src/main/resources/META-INF/beans.xml
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
include::{beans-xml}[tag=beans]
----

=== Create a bean to hold the greeting message
The app contains a default greeting loaded from configuration which the user 
can set via HTTP. 
The app stores the current message in a JAX-RS bean so we can inject it where
we need it.

Add these imports:
[source,java]
----
include::{greeting-message-class}[tags=mainImports;mpImports]
----

. Create `GreetingMessage.java`
. Annotate the class with `javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped`
+
This makes sure that the system allocates one instance of `GreetingMessage` and
uses it for all requests.
. You need a `String` field to hold the greeting that can handle potential concurrent attempts to update it,
because your application might receive multiple concurrent HTTP requests that
try to modify the message. One way is to add an `AtomicReference` for a `String`:
+
[source,java]
----
include::{greeting-message-class}[tag=messageDecl]
----
. Add a constructor annotated with `javax.inject.Inject` and which
accepts the initial message value as a `String`.
+
[source,java]
----
include::{greeting-message-class}[tag=ctor]
----
<1> Causes the annotated parameter to be processed and injected.
<2> The `ConfigProperty` annotation triggers automatic MP config processing
to look up the `app.greeting` config value from (in our case) the default
MP config source: `META-INF/microprofile-config.properties`.
<3> Assigns the parameter value to the `AtomicString` field.

. Add a getter and setter for the `message`
+
[source,java]
----
include::{greeting-message-class}[tag=getter]

include::{greeting-message-class}[tag=setter]
----

=== Create a JAX-RS root resource for the application
This class defines the endpoints for the application.

Add these imports:
[source,java]
----
include::{greet-resource-class}[tag=javaxImports]
----

. Create the `GreetResource.java` file.
Mark it as request-scoped and declare the common path prefix that
all endpoints in the resource share.
+
[source,java]
----
include::{greet-resource-class}[tag=classDecl]
}
----

. Create a private field for the application's `GreetingMessage`
+
[source,java]
----
include::{greet-resource-class}[tag=greetingMessageDecl]
----
The system injects our application-scoped `GreetingMessage`
instance.

. Write a private method to format the message your endpoints
return to the clients.
+
[source,java]
----
include::{greet-resource-class}[tag=createResponse]
----
<1> `who` is the name of the end-user we want to greet
<2> Retrieves the message from the `GreetingMessage` bean and embeds the end-user name
in it.
<3> Prepares the response as JSON.

=== Add the code for the resource's endpoints
. Returning the default message
+
[source,java]
----
include::{greet-resource-class}[tag=getDefaultMessage]
----
<1> Indicates the HTTP method: `GET`.
<2> Tells JAX-RS that this method returns JSON.

. Returning the personalized greeting
+
[source,java]
----
include::{greet-resource-class}[tag=getMessageWithName]
----
<1> Declares the path parameter which is the name to use for personalizing
the returned message.
<2> Indicates the HTTP method: `GET`.
<3> Tells JAX-RS that this method returns JSON.
<4> Triggers injection of the path parameter `name` as an argument to the method.

. Setting a new greeting message
+
[source,java]
----
include::{greet-resource-class}[tag=setGreeting]
----
<1> Identifies the path parameter for the new greeting text.
<2> It's an HTTP `PUT`.
<3> Tells JAX-RS that this method both consumes and produces JSON.
<4> JAX-RS injects the new greeting from the path parameter as the method argument.

=== Add an `Application` class
JAX-RS looks for an `Application`. Create `GreetApplication.java`.
Add these imports:
[source,java]
----
include::{greet-application-class}[tags=javaImports;helidonImports]
----

[source,java]
.GreetApplication.java
----
include::{greet-application-class}[tags=greetAppBody;!healthAdditionToGetClasses]
----
<1> Have JAX-RS create only one instance of this class.
<2> No path prefix for this application.
<3> Class must extend `javax.ws.rs.core.Application`.

The `getClasses` method reports the resource classes in the application. We will
add to this method later.

=== Write the `Main` class
Add these imports:
[source,java]
----
include::{main-class}[tags=javaImports;helidonMPImports]
----

. Add the `startServer` method
+
[source,java]
----
include::{main-class}[tag=startServer]
----
<1> Automatically reads server configuration from `microprofile-config.properties`
and then starts the reactive web server.

. Write a method to initialize logging
+
[source,java]
----
include::{main-class}[tag=setupLogging]
----
<1> Loads logging config from `logging.properties`

. Add or modify the `main` method
+
[source,java]
----
include::{main-class}[tag=main]
----

== Build and run
include::{se-guide-adoc}[tag=buildAndRun]

== Add health checks
include::{se-guide-adoc}[tag=addHealthChecksIntro]

=== Add a new JAX-RS resource class
Create `HealthResource.java` to define the endpoints for checking if the service is
active and if it is ready. 

Add these imports:
[source,java]
----
include::{health-resource-class}[tag=javaxImports]
----

. Declare the class with these annotations:
+
[source,java]
----
include::{health-resource-class}[tag=classDecl]
}
----

. Declare an injected instance field to refer to the greeting message resource. This
is the only input to the active check in our simple implementation.
+
[source,java]
----
include::{health-resource-class}[tag=greetingDecl]
----
<1> Indicates that JAX-RS should inject the field.
<2> Because `GreetingMessage` is an application-scoped bean, JAX-RS will inject a
reference to the single instance every time it creates this request-scoped resource.

. Add the `checkHealth` method which decides whether the greeting resource is active
(healthy) or not.
+
[source,java]
----
include::{health-resource-class}[tag=checkHealthMethod]
----

. Add the method to implement the `/alive` endpoint
+
[source,java]
----
include::{health-resource-class}[tag=aliveMethod]
----
<1> Implements the path `/alive`.
<2> It's an HTTP `GET`.
<3> Gets a `String` describing why the resource should _not_ be considered alive;
null if the resource is OK.
<4> Build the `Response` object for return accordingly.

. Add the method to implement `/ready`
+
[source,java]
----
include::{health-resource-class}[tag=readyMethod]
----

=== Update `GreetApplication`
In the `getClasses` method add `HealthResource.class` to the arguments
passed to `CollectionsHelper.setOf`:

[source,java]
----
include::{greet-application-class}[tags=getClassesMethod]
----

include::{se-guide-adoc}[tags=rebuildAndRerunService;tryReadiness;tryLiveness]

== Add metrics support
include::{se-guide-adoc}[tag=metricsIntro]

. Add the metrics dependency to `pom.xml`
+
[source,xml]
----
include::{pom}[tag=metricsDependency]
----

. Annotate each method to be measured, in our case `getDefaultMessage`, 
`getMessage`, and `updateGreeting`. (We annotate `updateGreeting` for simplicity
and so the metrics
reported here have the same values as for the Helidon SE RESTful web 
service example. In a real application we might measure the `update` method separately
from the `get` methods.)
+
Add these imports:
+
[source,java]
----
include::{greet-resource-class}[tag=metricsImports]
----
+
[source,java]
----
include::{greet-resource-class}[tag=countedAnno]
----
<1> Marks this method as measured by a `Counter` metric.
<2> Declares the unique name for this counter among all metrics.
<3> Allows the same counter to accumulate uses of multiple methods.
<4> Indicates that the metrics system should increment the counter on each invocation but
_not_ decrement it when the method returns. 

=== Stop, rebuild and rerun your application

. Stop any running instance of your app.
. Rebuild the app and then run it.

=== Send some requests
Use the same `curl` commands as before to send requests to
the server:

|====
|Command 
a|[source,bash]
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/greet
a|[source,bash]
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/greet/Joe
a|[source,bash]
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/greet/greeting/Hola
a|[source,bash]
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/greet/Jose
|====

=== Retrieve metrics
Run this `curl` command to retrieve the collected metrics:
[source,bash]
----
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/metrics/application <1>
----
<1> Requests all application-scoped metrics (we only have one).
You should see this output (in Prometheus format):
[listing]
----
# TYPE application:io_helidon_guides_mp_restfulwebservice_greet_resource_accessctr counter
# HELP application:io_helidon_guides_mp_restfulwebservice_greet_resource_accessctr Total greetings accesses
application:io_helidon_guides_mp_restfulwebservice_greet_resource_accessctr 4
----
Note that:

. The name of the counter is automatically qualified with the package and class name of the JAX-RS
resource that records the metric (`io_helidon_guides_mp_restfulwebservice_greet_resource_accessctr`). If we
had added `absolute=true` to the `@Counted` annotation attributes then the name would be
simply `accessctr`.

. The first two lines are gathered from the metadata we included in the `@Counted` 
annotation.

. As expected, the value for the counter is 4.

A `curl` to `http://localhost:8080/metrics` lists not only our application-scoped 
metric but all the _base_ and _vendor_ metrics as defined in the MP metrics spec. 
For example, you will see a `vendor:requests_count` 
counter. This will be larger than our counter because that counter also tracks 
requests to the `/metrics` path itself; our `accessctr` counter tracks only requests to
our application endpoints.

== (Optional) Download the example source [[downloading]]
Instead of building the application using the code snippets in this guide, 
you can download it.

for Helidon]
. `cd` to the `examples/guides/mp-restful-webservice` directory.
. Run:
+
[source,bash]
----
mvn package
java -jar target/mp-restful-webservice.jar
