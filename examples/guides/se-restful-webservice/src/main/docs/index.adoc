= The RESTful Web Service Guide
:description: Helidon guide restful web service
:keywords: helidon, guide, example
:toc: preamble

Create and build a RESTful web service as your first Helidon SE application.

== What you will learn
You'll learn how to use Helidon quickly to create a RESTful web service that accepts these HTTP requests:

|===
|Method and URL | Result

|`GET localhost:8080/greet` |Returns a generic but friendly greeting
|`GET localhost:8080/greet/Joe` |Returns a personalized greeting for the specified person
|`PUT localhost:8080/greet/greeting/Hola` |Changes the greeting used in subsequent responses
|===

We create the app in three main steps:

. Write a basic Helidon SE app to respond to the HTTP requests.

. Add code to perform simple health checks.

. Add code to record simple metrics.

This guide walks you through the code and helps you understand what each part of the 
code does as you write the app. But if you prefer, you can get the finished code for this example.
See the <<downloading,downloading>> section for instructions.


== What you need

|===
|About 15 minutes
|An IDE or text editor
|JDK 1.8 or later
|Maven 3.5 or later
|===

//Optional:
//|===
//|Docker 18.02 (use the Edge channel to run Kubernetes on your desktop)
//|`kubectl` 1.7.4
//|===

== Develop your application

=== Create a new Maven project
You can create your Maven project in these ways:

* use your IDE to create a new Java Maven project, or
* run the standard Maven archetype to create a new Java project using this command:
+
[source,bash]
mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.maven.archetypes -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DarchetypeVersion=1.3

=== Update your `pom.xml`
Add the properties and dependencies listed here if they don't exist in your `pom.xml`:
[source,xml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
    <properties>
include::{pom}[tags=helidonVersion;javaVersions]
    </properties>

    <dependencyManagement>
        <dependencies>
include::{pom}[tag=depMgt]
        </dependencies>
    </dependencyManagement>
----
Now you can add Helidon dependencies to your project without having to specify the version.
For this example add these dependencies:
[source,xml]
----
    <dependencies>
include::{pom}[tags=webserverBundleDependency;configYamlDependency]
    </dependencies>
----
<1> Incorporates the Helidon web server.
<2> Pulls in support for YAML as a config format.

If you run your project from the IDE, the IDE typically handles the main class and places
dependent JARs on the runtime classpath for you and your pom is now ready to go. 

// tag::runMavenOutsideIDE[]
==== To run Maven outside your IDE
If you want to use Maven yourself,
outside the IDE, then add the following to your pom. (This is typical with Maven
projects and is not specific to Helidon or this example):
[source,xml]
----
    <properties>
        ...
        <mainClass>your-fully-qualified-main-class</mainClass> <!--1-->
include::{pom}[tag=libsCopying]
        ...
    </properties>

    <build>
        <pluginManagement>
            <plugins>
include::{pom}[tag=mainClassPlugin]
            </plugins>
        </pluginManagement>
        <plugins>
include::{pom}[tag=copyDependencies]
        </plugins>
    </build>
----
<1> Make sure to specify your own main class path.
<2> Instructs Maven what main class to set in the JAR's manifest and what prefix to use for
copied dependency JARs.
<3> Tells Maven to package the dependency JARs in the specified directory relative to the project's JAR.
// end::runMavenOutsideIDE[]

=== Create a config resource file
Your app will use the Helidon config support to initialize the greeting and set up HTTP
listening.

Create this config file:

.`src/main/resources/application.yaml`
[source,yaml]
----
include::../resources/application.yaml[tag=configContent]
----
<1> Sets the initial greeting text for responses from the service
<2> Sets how the service will listen for requests

=== Create a logging properties file
.`src/main/resources/logging.properties`
[source]
----
include::../resources/logging.properties[tag=loggingProps]
----

=== Create your "Greet" Service
In general, your application can implement multiple services, each tied to its own
URL path. We'll start with just one service: the greeting service.

Create a new Java class `GreetService.java` as follows. Add these Java `import` statements:
[source,java]
----
include::{greet-service}[tags=importsStart;importsWebServer]
----

. Make `GreetService` implement `io.helidon.webserver.Service`.
. Set two static fields by reading the config file and setting the initial greeting from 
the loaded config:
+
[source,java]
----
include::{greet-service}[tags=CONFIG;greetingDef]
----
<1> Loads the config from the (default) `application.yaml` resource you created earlier
and loads the subtree rooted at the `app` entry into the `CONFIG` field. The
type of the field is `io.helidon.config.Config`.
<2> Sets the initial greeting from the config, using "Ciao" if the expected
entry is missing from the loaded config.
+
. Implement the responses to the three types of request by adding three methods.
.. Returning the default greeting
+
[source,java]
----
include::{greet-service}[tag=getDefaultMessage]
---- 
<1> Gets the greeting (defaults to "Hello") from the current setting (and adds "World").
<2> Creates the JSON response from the message and builds the response.
<3> Sends the response to the client.
.. Returning a personalized greeting
+
[source,java]
----
include::{greet-service}[tag=getMessage]
----
<1> Get the name from the URL path in the request and use it in buildig the 
JSON response.
The rest of the method is the same as `getDefaultMessage`.
.. Updating the greeting
+
[source,java]
----
include::{greet-service}[tag=updateGreeting]
----
<1> Save the new greeting from the URL path in the request.
<2> Compose the JSON response to confirm the new setting for `greeting`.
. Link your logic with the correct URL paths
+
[source,java]
----
include::{greet-service}[tags=updateStart;updateGetsAndPuts]
----
<1> Each service overrides `update` to define its routing rules.
<2> Handle `GET` requests with no extra path using `getDefaultMessage`.
<3> Handle `GET` requests with a name using `getMessage` which personalizes the response
using the name provided as the path suffix.
<4> Handle `PUT` requests to the `greeting` path using `updateGreeting`,
interpreting the end of the path as the new greeting string.

=== Write your main class
You need just a little more code so your app starts the Helidon web server
and makes it aware of your greeting service.

Add these Java `import` statements:
[source,java]
----
include::{main-class}[tags=importsStart;importsWebServer;importsEnd]
----
. Add a field to your main class to hold a reference to a `GreetService` instance.
+
[source,java]
----
include::{main-class}[tag=greetServiceDecl]
----

. Add a method to your main class to set up routing for your app.
+
[source,java]
----
include::{main-class}[tags=createRoutingStart;createRoutingBasic;registerGreetService;createRoutingEnd]
----
<1> Creates and saves the reference to the `GreetService`. (We'll use `greeting` reference again
later when we add support for health checking.)
<2> Tells the Helidon web server that you want to use JSON.
<3> Associates the greeting service with the `/greet` path. 

. Add the `startServer` method.
+
[source,java]
----
include::{main-class}[tag=startServer]
----
<1> Gets the webserver config from the "server" section of `application.yaml`. The
config system automatically maps the config's `host` and `port` to those 
attributes of `ServerConfiguration`.
<2> Creates the web server using the routing rules from the `createRouting` method.
<3> Starts the web server, then logs a message.
<4> Set up a shutdown hook so when the web server is shut down (for example, by ^C on the console) 
the app prints a message.

. Write your main method
+
Add
+
[source,java]
----
include::{main-class}[tag=mainContent]
----
+
to your main method.

== Build and run
// tag::buildAndRun[]
You can use your IDE's features to build and run the project directly.

Or, to use Maven outside the IDE, build your app this way:
[source,bash]
mvn package

and run it like this:
[source,bash]
java -jar target/your-jar-name.jar

Once you have started your app, from another command window run these commands 
to access its functions (order is important for the last two):
[[curl-command-table]]
|====
|Command |Result |Function

a|[source,bash]
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/greet
a|[listing]
{"message":"Hello World!"}
|Returns a greeting with no personalization

a|[source,bash]
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/greet/Joe
a|[listing]
{"message":"Hello Joe!"}
|Returns the personalized greeting

a|[source,bash]
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/greet/greeting/Hola
a|[listing]
{"greeting":"Hola"}
|Changes the greeting

a|[source,bash]
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/greet/Jose
a|[listing]
{"message":"Hola Jose!"}
|Shows that the greeting change took effect
|====
// end::buildAndRun[]

== Add health checks
// tag::addHealthChecksIntro[]
A well-behaved microservice reports on its own health.
Two common approaches for checking health, often used together, are:

- readiness - a simple verification that the service has been started, has initialized itself,
and is ready to respond to requests; and
- liveness - often a more thorough assessment of whether
and how well the service can do its job.

For example, Kubernetes can ping your service's 
readiness endpoint after it starts the pod containing the service to determine 
when the service is ready to accept requests, withholding traffic until the readiness
endpoint reports success. Kubernetes can use the liveness endpoint to find out if
the service considers itself able to function, attempting a pod restart if the
endpoint reports a problem.

In general a liveness check might assess:

- service health - whether the service itself can do its job correctly
- host health - if the host has sufficient resources (for example, disk space)
for the service to operate
- health of other, dependent services - if other services on which this service
depends are themselves OK.

For this example we define our service as "alive" in a very trivial way. 
Our greeting service does not depend on any
host resources (like disk space) or any other services. So we choose to define our
greeting service to be OK if the greeting text has been assigned
_and is not empty_ when trimmed of leading or trailing white space. Otherwise we
consider the service to be unhealthy, in which case the service will
still respond but its answers might not be what we want. 

Normally we would 
write our service to make 
sure that a newly-assigned greeting is non-empty _before_
accepting it. But omitting that validation lets us create an easy health check
that we can use by simply setting the greeting to blank from 
a `curl` command.
// end::addHealthChecksIntro[]

=== Add code to `GreetService.java`

For our simple service, assess health simply by making sure the greeting contains
something other than blanks.

[source,java]
----
include::{greet-service}[tag=checkHealth]
----

=== Add code to `Main.java`

Now let's add the code to actually implement the readiness and liveness endpoints to
to the `Main` class.

Add these imports:
[source,java]
include::{main-class}[tags=importsHealth1;importsHealth2;importsHealth3]

. Add a new `ready` method
+
[source,java]
----
include::{main-class}[tag=ready]
----
This method simply returns 200 so the client knows the service is up.
. Add a new `alive` method
+
[source,java]
----
include::{main-class}[tag=alive]
----
<1> Delegates to `GreetService` to evaluate the liveness of the service -- in our case, is the greeting non-empty.
<2> Replies with a simple 200 for the health case.
<3> For the unhealthy case prepares a description of the problem...
<4> ...and replies with a 500.

. Add the new endpoints to the routing
+
In the `createRouting` method in `Main.java` insert these lines immediately
after the `.register` invocations:
+
[source,java]
----
include::{main-class}[tag=createRoutingHealth]
----
These link the health-related endpoints your code is exposing to the new methods.

// tag::rebuildAndRerunService[]
=== Stop, rebuild and rerun your service

. Stop any running instance of your app.
. Rebuild the app and then run it.

// end::rebuildAndRerunService[]

// tag::tryReadiness[]

=== Try the readiness check
Access the readiness check endpoint:
[source,bash]
curl -i -X GET http://localhost:8080/ready

Our readiness check returns no payload, just the 200 status, so you won't see any data
displayed. The `-i` option shows the
200 status in the response.
// end::tryReadiness[]

// tag::tryLiveness[]

=== Try the liveness check
. Ping the health check endpoint
+
Without changing the greeting, ping the health endpoint:
[source,bash]
curl -i -X GET http://localhost:8080/alive
+
The greeting is valid and in that case our health check code simply returns a 200
with no payload. 

. Set the greeting to a blank
+
[source,bash]
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/greet/greeting/%20
+
Our code to update the greeting accepts this and saves it as the new greeting.

. Ping the health check endpoint again with the same command as before
+
[source,bash]
curl -i -X GET http://localhost:8080/alive
+
This time you should see
[listing]
{"error":"greeting is not set or is empty"}
+
and with the `-i` added to the `curl` command you would see the 500 status returned.
// end::tryLiveness[]

== Add metrics support
// tag::metricsIntro[]
As a simple illustration of using metrics, we revise our greeting service to count how many times
a client sends a request to the app.
// end::metricsIntro[]

. Add the metrics dependency to `pom.xml`
+
[source,xml]
----
include::{pom}[tag=metricsDependency]
----
. Enable metrics in `Main.java`
+
Add these imports:
+
[source,java]
----
include::{main-class}[tag=importsMetrics]
----
.. Register metrics support in request routing 
+
In `Main.createRouting`:

... Just before the code instantiates `GreetService` add this:
+
[source,java]
----
include::{main-class}[tag=initMetrics]
----
<1> Initializes the metrics infrastructure in Helidon.

... Just after the invocation of `register(JsonSupport.get())`
add this
+
[source,java]
----
include::{main-class}[tag=registerMetrics]
----
<1> Registers the `MetricsSupport` handler with the web server's
handler chain.
+
Here is the whole, updated method:
+
[source,java]
include::{main-class}[tag=createRoutingFull]

. Revise `GreetService.java` for metrics
+
Add these imports:
+
[source,java]
----
include::{greet-service}[tags=importsHelidonMetrics;importsMPMetrics]
----

.. Register a metric in `GreetService.java`
+
Add these declarations as private fields:
+
[source,java]
----
include::{greet-service}[tags=metricsRegistration;counterRegistration]
----
<1> Refers to the application-scoped metrics registry.
<2> Declares a metric of type `counter`.

.. Create a method to display which method is handling a request.
+
Add this method:
+
[source,java]
----
include::{greet-service}[tag=displayThread]
----

.. Create a request handler to update the counter
+
Add this method:
+
[source,java]
----
include::{greet-service}[tag=counterFilter]
----
<1> Shows which method is handling the request.
<2> Updates the counter metric.
<3> Lets the next handler process the same request.

.. Register a filter to count requests
+
To the `update` method add this line immediately before the
existing `get` invocations.
+
[source,java]
----
include::{greet-service}[tag=updateForCounter]
----
<1> Invokes `counterFilter` for _any_ incoming request.

=== Rebuild and rerun your application
Follow the same steps as before, remembering to stop any instance
of your application that is still running.

=== Send some requests
Use the same `curl` commands from the beginning to send requests to the server:

|====
|Command |Server Output

a|[source,bash]
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/greet
a|[listing]
Method=counterFilter Thread=nioEventLoopGroup-3-1

a|[source,bash]
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/greet/Joe
a|[listing]
Method=counterFilter Thread=nioEventLoopGroup-3-2

a|[source,bash]
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/greet/greeting/Hola
a|[listing]
Method=counterFilter Thread=nioEventLoopGroup-3-3

a|[source,bash]
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/greet/Jose
a|[listing]
Method=counterFilter Thread=nioEventLoopGroup-3-4
|====

=== Retrieve metrics
Run this `curl` command to retrieve the collected metrics:
[source,bash]
----
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/metrics
----

You should see a long JSON result. Note two parts:
|====
|Output |Meaning

a|[listing]
"application":{"accessctr":4}

|The counter we added to the app

a|[listing]
"requests.meter":{"count":5, ...

|The total HTTP requests the Helidon web server received (and several values
reflecting the request arrival rate)
|====
The request count is higher because the access to `/metrics` to retrieve the
monitoring data is _not_ handled by our app's rules and filters but by the 
metrics infrastructure.
