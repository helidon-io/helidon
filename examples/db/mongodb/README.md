# Helidon DB mongoDB Example

This example shows how to run Helidon DB over mongoDB.


## Build

```
mvn package
```

## Run

This example requires a mongoDB database, start it using docker:
`docker run --rm --name mongo -p 27017:27017 mongo`

Then run the `io.helidon.examples.db.mongo.Main` class
 
##Â Exercise

The application has the following endpoints:

- http://localhost:8080/db - the main business endpoint (see `curl` commands below)
- http://localhost:8080/metrics - the metrics endpoint (query adds application metrics)
- http://localhost:8080/health - has a custom database health check

Application also connects to zipkin on default address.
The query operation adds database trace.

`curl` commands:

- `curl http://localhost:8080/db` - list all Pokemon in the database
- `curl -i -X POST -d '{"name":"Squirtle","type":"water"}' http://localhost:8080/db` - add a new pokemon
- `curl http://localhost:8080/db/Squirtle` - get a single pokemon
- `curl -i -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/db/Squirtle` - delete a single pokemon
- `curl -i -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/db` - delete all pokemon

The application also supports update and delete - see `PokemonService.java` for bound endpoints.
