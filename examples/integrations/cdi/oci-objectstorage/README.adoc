= OCI Object Storage CDI Integration Example

== Build

----
mvn clean install
----

== Deploy to Kubernetes

First you need to create Kubernetes secrets to store sensitive OCI
information.

To start, make a copy of the Bash script located (after building the
project) in `target/oci.secrets.template` and name it whatever you
like.  This guide will refer to it as, simply, `oci.secrets`.

Now edit `oci.secrets` to contain the information you'll need to
connect to OCI services.

Once you have properly customized the variables in `oci.secrets`, you
can execute it.  `kubectl`, invoked by the script, will create a
Kubernetes secret that will contain all the OCI connectivity
information.
