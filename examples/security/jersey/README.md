# Security integration with Jersey

This example demonstrates integration with Jersey (JAX-RS implementation).

## Contents

There are three examples with exactly the same behavior
1. builder - shows how to secure application using security built by hand
2. config - shows how to secure application with configuration
    1. see `src/main/resources/application.yaml`
3. programmatic - shows how to secure application using manual invocation of authentication
