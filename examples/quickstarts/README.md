# Helidon Quickstart Examples

These are the examples used by the Helidon Getting Started guide, and
the quickstart Maven archetypes. All examples implement the same
simple greeting service, one using Helidon MP and one using Helidon SE.

The `archetypes` directory contains scripts for building the Maven
archetypes from these examples.
