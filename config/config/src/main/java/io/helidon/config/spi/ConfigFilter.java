/**
 * Filter that can transform elementary configuration ({@code String}) values
 * before they are returned via the {@link Config} API.
 * <p>
 * The application can register filters with a builder by invoking
 * {@link Config.Builder#addFilter(ConfigFilter)} or {@link
 * Config.Builder#addFilter(java.util.function.Function)}. The
 * config system also locates filters using the Java
 * {@link java.util.ServiceLoader} mechanism and automatically adds them to
 * every {@code Builder} unless the application disables this feature for a
 * given {@code Builder} by invoking
 * {@link Config.Builder#disableFilterServices()}.
 * <p>
 * A filter can specify a {@link javax.annotation.Priority}. If no priority is
 * explicitly assigned, the value of {@value PRIORITY} is assumed.
 * <h2>Initializing Filters</h2>
 * Any filter that uses the {@code Config} instance during its initialization
 * should do so in its {@link #init(Config)} method,
 * <em>not</em>
 * in its constructor. The {@code Config.Builder.build()} method invokes each
 * filter's `init` method according to the filters' priority order and just
 * before returning the new {@code Config} instance to the application.
 * <p>
 * If a filter's {@code init} method uses {@code Config#get} to retrieve config
 * information, then -- as always -- the config system will invoke the
 * {@code apply} method on every filter which the application added to the
 * builder. But the {@code init} methods of filters with lower priority than the
 * current filter <em>will not</em> have executed. Developers should keep this
 * in mind while writing filter {@code init} methods.
 *
 * @see Config.Builder#addFilter(ConfigFilter)
