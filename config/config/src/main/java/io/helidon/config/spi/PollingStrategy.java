/**
 * Mechanism for notifying interested subscribers when they should check for
 * changes that might have been made to the data used to create a {@code Config}
 * tree, as accessed through {@link ConfigSource}s.
 * <p>
 * Once it loads a {@link Config} tree from {@link ConfigSource}s the config
 * system does not itself change the in-memory {@code Config} tree. Even so, the
 * underlying data available via the tree's {@code ConfigSource}s can change.
 * Implementations of {@code PollingStrategy} other interested code to learn
 * when changes to that underlying data might have occurred.
 * <p>
 * In implementations of {@code PollingStrategy} the {@link #ticks()} method
 * returns a {@link Flow.Publisher} of {@link PollingEvent}s to which the
 * application or the {@code ConfigSource}s themselves can subscribe. Generally,
 * each event is a hint to the application or a {@code ConfigSource} itself that
 * it should check to see if any of the underlying config data it relies on
 * might have changed. Note that a {@code PollingStrategy}'s publication of an
 * event does not necessarily guarantee that the underlying data has in fact
 * changed, although this might be true for some {@code PollingStrategy}
 * implementations.
 * <p>
 * Typically a custom {@link ConfigSource} implementation creates a
 * {@code Flow.Subscriber} which it uses to subscribe to the
 * {@code Flow.Publisher} that is returned from the
 * {@code PollingStrategy.ticks()} method. When that subscriber receives a
 * {@code PollingEvent} it triggers the {@code ConfigSource} to reload the
 * configuration from the possibly changed underlying data. For example, each
 * {@link AbstractParsableConfigSource} can use a different
 * {@code PollingStrategy}.
 * <p>
 * As described with {@link io.helidon.config.MetaConfig#configSource(io.helidon.config.Config)}, the config system can
 * load {@code ConfigSource}s using meta-configuration, which supports
 * specifying polling strategies. All {@link PollingStrategies built-in polling
 * strategies} and custom ones are supported. (The support is tightly connected
 * with {@link AbstractSource.Builder#config(Config) AbstractSource extensions}
 * and will not be automatically provided by any another config source
 * implementations.)
 * <p>
 * The meta-configuration for a config source can set the property
 * {@code polling-strategy} using the following nested {@code properties}:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code type} - name of the polling strategy implementation.
 * <table class="config">
 * <caption>Built-in Polling Strategies</caption>
 * <tr>
 * <th>Name</th>
 * <th>Strategy</th>
 * <th>Required Properties</th>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>{@code regular}</td>
 * <td>Scheduled polling at regular intervals. See
 * {@link PollingStrategies#regular(Duration)}.</td>
 * <td>{@code interval} in {@link Duration} format, e.g. {@code PT15S} means 15
 * seconds</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>{@code watch}</td>
 * <td>Filesystem monitoring of the {@code Path} specified in the config source
 * definition. See {@link PollingStrategies#watch(Path)}.
 * <p>
 * Use this strategy only with config sources based on
 * {@link AbstractSource.Builder} that are paramaterized with {@code Path}. This
 * includes null {@link io.helidon.config.ConfigSources#classpath(String) classpath},
 * {@link io.helidon.config.ConfigSources#file(String) file} and
 * {@link io.helidon.config.ConfigSources#directory(String) directory} config
 * sources.
 * </td>
 * <td>n/a</td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 * <p>
 * </li>
 * <li>{@code class} - fully-qualified class name of a custom polling strategy
 * implementation or a builder class that implements a {@code build()} method
 * that returns a {@code PollingStrategy}.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * For a given config source use either {@code type} or {@code class} to
 * indicate a polling strategy but not both. If both appear the config system
 * ignores the {@code class} setting.
 * <h3>Meta-configuration Support for Custom Polling Strategies</h3>
 * To support settings in meta-configuration, a custom polling strategy must
 * follow these patterns.
 * <ol>
 * <li>Auto-configuration from meta-configuration properties
 * <p>
 * The implementation class should define a Java bean property for each
 * meta-configuration property it needs to support. The config system uses
 * mapping functions to convert the text in the
 * meta-configuration into the correct Java type and then assigns the value to
 * the correspondingly-named Java bean property defined on the custom strategy
 * instance. See the built-in mappers defined in
 * {@link io.helidon.config.ConfigMappers} to see what Java types are automatically
 * supported.
 * </li>
 * <li>Accessing the {@code ConfigSource} meta-config attributes
 * <p>
 * The custom polling strategy can get access to the same meta-configuration
 * attributes that are used to construct the associated {@code ConfigSource}. To
 * do so the custom implementation class should implement a constructor that
 * accepts the same Java type as that returned by the
 * {@link AbstractSource.Builder#target()} method on the builder that is used
 * to construct the {@code ConfigSource}.
 * <p>
 * For example, a custom polling strategy useful with {@code ConfigSource}s
 * based on a {@code Path} would implement a constructor that accepts a
 * {@code Path} argument.
 * </li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * @see AbstractParsableConfigSource.Builder#pollingStrategy(Supplier)
