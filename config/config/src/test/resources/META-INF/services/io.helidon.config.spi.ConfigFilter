io.helidon.config.AutoLoadedConfigFilter

# The ordering of the next two entries is important, at least as of this writing.
# It makes sure that the (current) order in which ServiceLoader.load delivers
# the instances is not the priority order in which the filters should be applied.
# This helps make sure that the ordering logic in the config implementation
# works correctly to process filters in the correct priority order. Of course,
# the way ServiceLoader.load operates may change as Java evolves.
