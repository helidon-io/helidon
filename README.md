# Helidon: Java Libraries for Microservices

Project Helidon is a set of Java Libraries for writing microservices.
Helidon supports two programming models:

* Helidon MP: [MicroProfile 6.0](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile/releases/tag/6.0)
* Helidon SE: a small, functional style API

In either case your application is a Java SE program running on the
new Helidon Níma WebServer that has been written from the ground up to
use Java 21 Virtual Threads. With Helidon 4 you get the high throughput of a reactive server with the simplicity of thread-per-request style programming.

The Helidon SE API in Helidon 4 has changed significantly from Helidon 3. The use of virtual threads has enabled these APIs to change from asynchronous to blocking. This results in much simpler code that is easier to write, maintain, debug and understand. Earlier Helidon SE code will require modification to run on these new APIs. For more information see the [Helidon SE Upgrade Guide](https://helidon.io/docs/v4/#/se/guides/upgrade_4x).

Helidon 4 supports MicroProfile 6. This means your existing Helidon MP 3.x applications will run on Helidon 4 with only minor modifications. And since Helidon’s MicroProfile server is based on the new Níma WebServer you get all the benefits of running on virtual threads. For more information see the [Helidon MP Upgrade Guide](https://helidon.io/docs/v4/#/mp/guides/upgrade_4x).

Java 21 is required to use Helidon 4.

You also need Maven. We recommend 3.8.0 or newer.

**Full build**
```bash
$ mvn install
```

**Checkstyle**
```bash
# cd to the component you want to check
$ mvn validate  -Pcheckstyle
```

**Copyright**

```bash

$ mvn validate  -Pcopyright
```

**Spotbugs**

```bash
# cd to the component you want to check
$ mvn verify  -Pspotbugs
```

**Documentation**

```bash
