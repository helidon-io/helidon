== Overview
Microservices expose their health status primarily so external tools (for example, an orchestrator such as Kubernetes)
can monitor each service and take action, such as restarting a service instance if it has failed
or temporarily shunting traffic away from the instance if the service is unable to process
incoming requests normally.

== About the MicroProfile Health Specification
Helidon MP implements the MicroProfile Health
link:http://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-health-{health-release}/microprofile-health-spec.html[spec].
The spec prescribes how external tools probe a service's health checks and how you
implement health checks as part of your microservice that are specific to your service's needs.

== Concepts

=== Liveness and Readiness Checks

MicroProfile Health supports two types of health checks:

_Liveness_ checks report whether the runtime environment in which the service is running
is sufficient to support the work the service performs.
The environment is beyond the control of
the service itself and typically cannot improve without outside intervention.
If a microservice instance reports a `DOWN`
liveness check, it should never report `UP` later.
It will need to be stopped and a replacement instance created.

_Readiness_ checks report whether the service is _currently_ capable of performing its work.
A service that reports `DOWN` for its readiness cannot _at the moment_ do its job, but at
some future point it might become able to do so without requiring a restart.

The following table describes more about these two types of health checks, including how an orchestrator
such as Kubernetes might react.

=== Known Health Check Endpoints
A MicroProfile-compliant service reports its health via known REST endpoints. Helidon MP
provides these endpoints automatically as part of every MP microservice.

External management tools (or `curl` or browsers) retrieve liveness via `/health/live` and
readiness via `/health/ready`.

The following table summarizes the two types of health checks in MicroProfile Health.

.Types of Health Checks
|===
|Type | Meaning | REST endpoint | Kubernetes response on failure

|liveness
|whether the runtime environment is suitable
|`/health/live`
|Restarts container.

|readiness
|whether the microservice is currently capable of doing its work
|`/health/ready`
|Diverts requests away from the instance; periodically rechecks readiness and resumes traffic once the
microservice reports itself as ready.

=== Built-in and Custom Health Checks

==== Built-in Health Checks
Helidon provides built-in, default checks for each endpoint.
The built-in liveness checks include various environmental values, such as whether the JVM has detected deadlocks
or whether there is sufficient heap space. The built-in readiness check always reports `UP`.

You can see all the defaults by accessing any Helidon MP microservice's `/health/live` endpoint
and viewing the response.

==== Custom Health Checks
Add your own liveness or readiness checks by adding a Java class for each check.
Each custom check must implement the `HealthCheck` interface, and you add either the `@Liveness` or
the `@Readiness` annotation to the class.

=== Next Steps
Add custom health checks to your own microservices.

The
<<mp/guides/04_health.adoc, Helidon MP Health Check Guide>> shows how to create a
sample project and add custom liveness and readiness health checks.
