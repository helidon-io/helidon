= Configuring the Server
:h1Prefix: MP
:description: Helidon MicroProfile server configuration
:keywords: helidon, microprofile, micro-profile

By default, the server uses the MicroProfile Config, but you may also want to use Helidon configuration.

== Configuring the Server

There are 3 default MicroProfile Config sources:

* `System.getProperties()`
* `System.getenv()`
* all `META-INF/microprofile-config.properties` files on the class path
* `application.yaml` on the classpath (read by default by Helidon Config)

In this example, the configuration is in a file, and it includes Helidon configuration options.

[source,properties]
.META-INF/microprofile-config.properties - Server configuration
----
# default is localhost
server.host=some.host
# default is 7001
server.port=7011

# Helidon configuration (optional)

# Length of queue for incoming connections. Default is 1024
server.backlog=512
# TCP receive window. Default is 0 to use implementation default
server.receive-buffer=256
# Socket timeout milliseconds - defaults to 0 (infinite)
server.timeout=30000
# Defaults to Runtime.availableProcessors()
server.workers=4
----

== Configuring TLS

Helidon MP also supports custom TLS configuration.

User is able to set following properties:

* Server truststore
    - Keystore with trusted certificates
* Private key and certificate
    - Server certificate which will be used in TLS handshake

[source,properties]
.META-INF/microprofile-config.properties - Server configuration
----
#Truststore setup
server.tls.trust.keystore.resource.resource-path=server.p12
server.tls.trust.keystore.passphrase=password
server.tls.trust.keystore.trust-store=true

#Keystore with private key and server certificate
server.tls.private-key.keystore.resource.resource-path=server.p12
server.tls.private-key.keystore.passphrase=password
----

Or the same configuration done in application.yaml file.

[source,yaml]
.application.yaml - Server configuration
----
server:
  tls:
    #Truststore setup
    trust:
      keystore:
        passphrase: "password"
        trust-store: true
        resource:
          resource-path: "keystore.p12"
    #Keystore with private key and server certificate
    private-key:
      keystore:
        passphrase: "password"
        resource:
          resource-path: "keystore.p12"
----

== Configuring additional ports

Helidon MP can expose multiple ports, with the following limitations:

- The default port is the port that serves your application (JAX-RS applications and resources)
- Other ports (in this example we configure one "admin" port) can be assigned endpoints that are exposed by Helidon components,
    currently supported by MP Health and MP Metrics

For this example, we will use a `yaml` file:

- The port `7011` is the default port and will serve your application
- The port `8011` is named "admin" (this is an arbitrary name)
- MP Metrics are configured to use the "admin" port through the `routing` configuration (reference is by name)
- MP Health is configured the same way to reference the "admin" port

[source,yaml]
.application.yaml - Server configuration
----
server:
  port: 7011
  host: "some.host"
  sockets:
    admin:
      port: 8011
      bind-address: "some.host"

metrics:
  routing: "admin"

health:
  routing: "admin"
----

== Assigning JAX-RS applications to ports

Since 1.4

Helidon has the concept of named routings. These correspond to the named ports
we have described in the previous section.

You can assign a JAX-RS application to a named routing (and as a result to a named port) using
either an annotation or configuration (or both to override the value from annotation).

=== Annotation `@RoutingName`
You can annotate an application with this annotation to assign it to a specific named routing,
that is (most likely) going to be bound to a specific port.

The annotation has two attributes:
- `value` that defines the routing name
- `required` to mark that the routing name MUST be configured in Helidon server

[source,yaml]
.`@RoutingName` example
----
@ApplicationScoped
@ApplicationPath("/admin")
@RoutingName(value="admin", required="true")
public class AdminApplication extends Application {
//....
}
----

The example above will be bound to `admin` routing (and port) and will fail if such a port
is not configured.

=== Configuration override of routing name

For each application class you can define the routing name and its required flag by specifying a configuration
option `class-name.routing-name.name` and `class-name.routing-name.required`.

Example (YAML) configuration for a class `io.helidon.examples.AdminApplication` that changes the
routing name to `management` and its required flag to `false`:

[source,yaml]
----
io.helidon.examples.AdminApplication:
  routing-name:
    name: "management"
    required: false
----

== Overriding JAX-RS application path

Since Helidon 1.4
In JAX-RS we can use `@ApplicationPath` to configure a path the JAX-RS application is available on.
As this is compiled into the source code, Helidon provides a way to override this using configuration.

For each application class you can define the routing path by specifying a configuration
option `class-name.routing-path.path`.

Example (YAML) configuration for a class `io.helidon.example.AdminApplication` that changes the
routing path to `/management`:

[source,yaml]
----
io.helidon.examples.AdminApplication:
  routing-path:
    path: "/management"
----

== Example configuration of JAX-RS application

A full configuration example (YAML):

[source,yaml]
----
server:
  port: 8080
  sockets:
    management:
      port: 8090

io.helidon.examples.AdminApplication:
  routing-name:
    name: "management"
    required: true
  routing-path:
    path: "/management"
