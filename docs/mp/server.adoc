== Overview

Helidon provides a MicroProfile server implementation (`io.helidon.microprofile.server`) that encapsulates the Helidon WebServer.

== Maven-Coordinates

To enable MicroProfile Server add the helidon-microprofile-core bundle dependency to your project's `pom.xml`
(see xref:../about/managing-dependencies.adoc[Managing Dependencies]).

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.microprofile.bundles</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-microprofile-core</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

MicroProfile Server is already included in the bundle.

If full control over the dependencies is required, and you want to minimize the quantity of the dependencies -
`Helidon MicroProfile Server` should be used. In this case the following dependencies should be included in your
project's `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.microprofile.server</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-microprofile-server</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

== Usage

Helidon Microprofile Server is used to collect and deploy JAX-RS application. It is recommended to instantiate the server directly
as is done in the xref:guides/quickstart.adoc[Helidon MP Quickstart example]. Note that the server lifecycle is bound to CDI.

== API

include::{rootdir}/config/io_helidon_microprofile_server_Server.adoc[leveloffset=+1,tag=config]

The following table provides a brief description of routing annotations, including its parameters. More information
in `Configuring a reactive route` section.

[cols="3,5", role="flex, sm10"]
|===
|Annotation |Description

a|
----
@RoutingName(
    value = ""
    required = false
)
----
| Binds a JAX-RS Application or Helidon Service to a specific (named) routing on `WebServer`.The routing should have
a corresponding named socket configured on the WebServer to run the routing on.

a|
----
@RoutingPath("/path")
----
| Path of a Helidon Service to register with routing.

|===

== Configuration

By default, the server uses the MicroProfile Config, but you may also want to use xref:config/introduction.adoc[Helidon configuration].

In this example, the configuration is in a file, and it includes Helidon configuration options.

include::{rootdir}/config/io_helidon_webserver_WebServer.adoc[leveloffset=+1,tag=config]

== Examples

=== Access Log

Access logging in Helidon is done by a dedicated module that can be
added to Maven and configured.

To enable Access logging add the following dependency to project's `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.microprofile</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-microprofile-access-log</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

=== Configuring Access Log in a configuration file

Access log can be configured as follows:

[source, properties]
.Access Log configuration file
----
server.port=8080
server.host=0.0.0.0
server.access-log.format=helidon
----

All options shown above are also available programmatically when using builder.

include::{rootdir}/includes/server/access-log-config-common.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

=== Configuring TLS

Helidon MP also supports custom TLS configuration.

You can set the following properties:

* Server truststore
- Keystore with trusted certificates
* Private key and certificate
- Server certificate which will be used in TLS handshake

[source,properties]
.META-INF/microprofile-config.properties - Server configuration
----
#Truststore setup
server.tls.trust.keystore.resource.resource-path=server.p12
server.tls.trust.keystore.passphrase=password
server.tls.trust.keystore.trust-store=true

#Keystore with private key and server certificate
server.tls.private-key.keystore.resource.resource-path=server.p12
server.tls.private-key.keystore.passphrase=password
----

Or the same configuration done in application.yaml file.

[source,yaml]
.application.yaml - Server configuration
----
server:
  tls:
    #Truststore setup
    trust:
      keystore:
        passphrase: "password"
        trust-store: true
        resource:
          resource-path: "keystore.p12"
    #Keystore with private key and server certificate
    private-key:
      keystore:
        passphrase: "password"
        resource:
          resource-path: "keystore.p12"
----

=== Configuring additional ports [[conf-additional-ports]]

Helidon MP can expose multiple ports, with the following limitations:

- The default port is the port that serves your application (JAX-RS applications and resources)
- Other ports (in this example we configure one "admin" port) can be assigned endpoints that are exposed by Helidon components,
currently supported by MP Health and MP Metrics

For this example, we will use a `YAML` file:

- The port `7011` is the default port and will serve your application
- The port `8011` is named "admin" (this is an arbitrary name)
- MP Metrics are configured to use the "admin" port through the `routing` configuration (reference is by name)
- MP Health is configured the same way to reference the "admin" port

[source,yaml]
.application.yaml - Server configuration
----
server:
  port: 7011
  host: "some.host"
  sockets:
    admin:
      port: 8011
      bind-address: "some.host"

metrics:
  routing: "admin"

health:
  routing: "admin"
----

=== Configuring A Reactive Route

Helidon MP Server will pick up CDI beans that implement the `io.helidon.webserver.Service`
interface and configure them with the underlying WebServer.

This allows configuration of reactive routes to run alongside a JAX-RS application.

The bean is expected to be either `ApplicationScoped` or `Dependent` and will be requested
only once during the boot of the `Server`.

The bean will support injection of `ApplicationScoped` and `Dependent` scoped beans.
You cannot inject `RequestScoped` beans. Please use WebServer features to handle request
related objects.

==== Customizing the reactive service
The service can be customized using annotations and/or configuration to be

- registered on a specific path
- registered with a named routing

==== Assigning a reactive service to named ports
Helidon has the concept of named routing. These correspond to the named ports
configured with WebServer.

You can assign a reactive service to a named routing (and as a result to a named port) using
either an annotation or configuration (or both to override the value from annotation).

===== Annotation `@RoutingName` [[annotation-routing-name]]
You can annotate a service bean with this annotation to assign it to a specific named routing,
that is (most likely) going to be bound to a specific port.

The annotation has two attributes:
- `value` that defines the routing name
- `required` to mark that the routing name MUST be configured in Helidon server

[source,java]
.`@RoutingName` example
----
@ApplicationScoped
@RoutingName(value="admin", required="true")
@RoutingPath("/admin")
public class AdminService implements Service {
}
----

The example above will be bound to `admin` routing (and port) and will fail if such a port
is not configured.

===== Configuration override of routing name

For each service bean you can define the routing name and its required flag by specifying a configuration
option `bean-class-name.routing-name.name` and `bean-class-name.routing-name.required`.
For service beans produced with producer method replace `bean-class-name` with `class-name.producer-method-name`.

Example (YAML) configuration for a service bean `io.helidon.examples.AdminService` that changes the
routing name to `management` and its required flag to `false`:

[source,yaml]
----
io.helidon.examples.AdminService:
  routing-name:
    name: "management"
    required: false
----

==== Configuring a reactive service path

Each service is registered on a path. If none is configured, then the service would be
configured on the root path.

You can configure service path using an annotation or configuration (or both to override value from annotation)

===== Annotation `@RoutingPath`

You can configure `@RoutingPath` to define the path a service is registered on.

===== Configuration override of routing path

For each reactive service class you can define the routing path by specifying a configuration
option `class-name.routing-path.path`.

Example (YAML) configuration for a class `io.helidon.example.AdminService` that changes the
routing path to `/management`:

[source,yaml]
----
io.helidon.examples.AdminService:
  routing-path:
    path: "/management"
----

=== Serving Static Content

[source,properties]
.META-INF/microprofile-config.properties - File system static content
----
# Location of content on file system
server.static.path.location=/var/www/html
# default is index.html
server.static.path.welcome=resource.html
# static content path - default is "/"
# server.static.path.context=/static-file
----

[source,properties]
.META-INF/microprofile-config.properties - Classpath static content
----
# src/main/resources/WEB in your source tree
server.static.classpath.location=/WEB
# default is index.html
server.static.classpath.welcome=resource.html
# static content path - default is "/"
# server.static.classpath.context=/static-cp
----


=== Example configuration of routing

A full configuration example (YAML):

[source,yaml]
----
server:
  port: 8080
  sockets:
   management:
   port: 8090

io.helidon.examples.AdminApplication:
  routing-name:
    name: "management"
    required: true
  routing-path:
    path: "/management"
----

=== Using Requested URI Discovery
include::{requested-uri-discovery-inc}[tag=intro]

==== Setting Up Requested URI Discovery

include::{requested-uri-discovery-inc}[tag=config-example-intro]

[source,properties]
.Configuring Request URI Discovery (properties format)
----
server.port=8080
server.requested-uri-discovery.types=FORWARDED,X_FORWARDED
server.requested-uri-discovery.trusted-proxies.allow.pattern=lb.*\\.mycorp\\.com
server.requested-uri-discovery.trusted-proxies.deny.exact=lbtest.mycorp.com
----
This example might apply if `mycorp.com` had trusted load balancers named `lbxxx.mycorp.com` except for an untrusted test load balancer `lbtest.mycorp.com`.

==== Obtaining the Requested URI Information
Helidon makes the requested URI information available as a property in the request context:

[source,java]
.Retrieving Requested URI Information
----
import io.helidon.common.http.UriInfo;

public class MyFilter implements ContainerRequestFilter {

    @Override
    public void filter(ContainerRequestContext requestContext) {
        UriInfo uriInfo = (UriInfo) requestContext.getProperty("io.helidon.jaxrs.requested-uri");
        // ...
    }
}
----
See the link:{common-http-javadoc-base-url}/io/helidon/common/http/UriInfo.html[`UriInfo`] JavaDoc for more information.

NOTE: The `requestContext.getUriInfo()` method returns the Jakarta RESTful web services `UriInfo` object, _not_ the Helidon-provided requested URI information `UriInfo` record.
