== Usage
Your application registers and updates Micrometer meters using annotations or direct use of the Micrometer API.

Your users retrieve Micrometer meters using an endpoint which Helidon creates automatically.

=== Registering and Updating Meters
To use Micrometer support, you can simply add the Micrometer `@Timed` and `@Counted` annotations to methods in your application. Helidon automatically registers those meters with the Micrometer composite `MeterRegistry`.

In addition to annotating your methods, your code
include::{rootdir}/includes/metrics/micrometer-shared.adoc[tag=use-micrometer-api]


include::{rootdir}/includes/metrics/micrometer-shared.adoc[tag=accessing-endpoint-intro]




== API
To incorporate Micrometer metrics into your code, you will work with two APIs: a small one specific to Helidon, and the Micrometer API itself.

=== The Helidon Micrometer API
Helidon automatically registers and updates meters associated with methods in your service where you add the Micrometer annotations.

If you want to use the Micrometer `MeterRegistry` directly from your own code, simply `@Inject` the `MeterRegistry` into one of your REST resource classes or any other bean which CDI recognizes. Helidon injects the same Micrometer `MeterRegistry` that it uses for handling Micrometer annotations you add to your code.

=== The Micrometer API

Your code
include::{rootdir}/includes/metrics/micrometer-shared.adoc[tag=use-micrometer-api]

// Configuration
include::{rootdir}/includes/metrics/micrometer-shared.adoc[tag=configuring-endpoint]

== Examples
include::{rootdir}/includes/metrics/micrometer-shared.adoc[tag=example-apps]

The examples below take you step-by-step through the process of enhancing the Helidon MP QuickStart application to track (by time and invocation count) all `GET` methods and to count all requests for a personalized greeting.

=== Add Micrometer annotations

[source,java]
.Adding Micrometer annotations to JAX-RS resource `GET` methods
----
import io.micrometer.core.annotation.Counted;
import io.micrometer.core.annotation.Timed;
    // <1>
    private static final String PERSONALIZED_GETS_COUNTER_NAME = "personalizedGets";
    private static final String PERSONALIZED_GETS_COUNTER_DESCRIPTION = "Counts personalized GET operations";
    private static final String GETS_TIMER_NAME = "allGets";
    private static final String GETS_TIMER_DESCRIPTION = "Tracks all GET operations";

    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    @Timed(value = GETS_TIMER_NAME, description = GETS_TIMER_DESCRIPTION, histogram = true) // <2>
    public JsonObject getDefaultMessage() {
        return createResponse("World");
    }

    @Path("/{name}")
    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    @Counted(value = PERSONALIZED_GETS_COUNTER_NAME, description = PERSONALIZED_GETS_COUNTER_DESCRIPTION) // <3>
    @Timed(value = GETS_TIMER_NAME, description = GETS_TIMER_DESCRIPTION, histogram = true) // <2>
    public JsonObject getMessage(@PathParam("name") String name) {
        return createResponse(name);
    }
----
<1> Declare constants used in annotating multiple methods.
<2> Use `@Timed` to time and count both `GET` methods.
<3> Use `@Counted` to count the accesses to the `GET` method that returns a personalized greeting.

=== Using the Helidon-provided Micrometer `MeterRegistry` from Code

In addition to annotating your methods, you can create, look up, and update metrics explicitly in your code.

Add the following injection to a bean:
[source,java]
.Inject the `MeterRegistry`
----
@Inject
private MeterRegistry registry;
----
Helidon automatically injects a reference to the `MeterRegistry` it manages into your code. Your code can use the
 normal Micrometer API with this registry to create, find, update, and even delete meters.
