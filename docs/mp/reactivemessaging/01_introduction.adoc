== Reactive Messaging

https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-reactive-messaging-1.0/microprofile-reactive-messaging-spec.html[MicroProfile Reactive Messaging]
uses CDI beans to produce, consume or process messages over Reactive Streams.
Such messaging bean is expected to be either in `ApplicationScoped` or `Dependent` scope.
Messages are managed by methods annotated by `@Incoming` and `@Outgoing`
and the invocation is always driven by message core - either at assembly time, or for every message coming from the stream.

WARNING: Messaging methods are not meant to be invoked directly!

[[terms]]
.Terms definition
|===
|https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-reactive-messaging-1.0/microprofile-reactive-messaging-spec.html#_supported_method_signatures[messaging method]| bean method invoked by messaging Specification
|https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-reactive-messaging-1.0/microprofile-reactive-messaging-spec.html#_connector[connector]| Reactive Messaging connector
|https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-reactive-messaging-1.0/microprofile-reactive-messaging-spec.html#_channel[channel]| named pair of producer and consumer, both sides can be either messaging method or connector
|===

The bean can have methods annotated by
https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-reactive-messaging-1.0/microprofile-reactive-messaging-spec.html#_message_consumption_with_incoming[`@Incoming`],
https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-reactive-messaging-1.0/microprofile-reactive-messaging-spec.html#_message_production_with_outgoing[`@Outgoing`] or both.

=== Consuming methods with `@Incoming` annotation

The annotation has one required attribute `value` that defines the channel name.

Such annotated <<terms,messaging method>> can function in two ways:

* consume every message coming from the stream connected to the <<terms, channel>>
* prepare reactive stream's subscriber and connect it to the channel

[source,java]
.Example consuming every message from channel `example-channel-2`:
----
@Incoming("example-channel-2")
public void printMessage(String msg) {
    System.out.println("Just received message: " + msg);
}
----

[source,java]
.Example preparing reactive stream subscriber for channel `example-channel-1`:
----
@Incoming("example-channel-2")
public Subscriber<String> printMessage() {
    return ReactiveStreams.<String>builder()
                .forEach(msg -> System.out.println("Just received message: " + msg))
                .build();
}
----

=== Producing methods with `@Outgoing` annotation

The annotation has one required attribute `value` that defines the
https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-reactive-messaging-1.0/microprofile-reactive-messaging-spec.html#_channel[channel]
name.

Such annotated <<terms,messaging method>> can function in two ways:

* produce exactly one message to the stream connected to the
https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-reactive-messaging-1.0/microprofile-reactive-messaging-spec.html#_channel[channel]
* prepare reactive stream's publisher and connect it to the
https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-reactive-messaging-1.0/microprofile-reactive-messaging-spec.html#_channel[channel]

[source,java]
.Example producing exactly one message to channel `example-channel-1`:
----
@Outgoing("example-channel-1")
public String produceMessage() {
    return "foo";
}
----

[source,java]
.Example preparing reactive stream publisher publishing three messages to the channel `example-channel-1`:
----
@Outgoing("example-channel-1")
public Publisher<String> printMessage() {
    return ReactiveStreams.of("foo", "bar", "baz").buildRs();
}
----

=== Processing methods with `@Incoming` and `@Outgoing` annotation

Such
https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-reactive-messaging-1.0/microprofile-reactive-messaging-spec.html#_method_consuming_and_producing[methods]
acts as processors, consuming messages from one channel and producing to another.

Such annotated <<terms,messaging method>> can function in multiple ways:

* process every message
* prepare reactive stream's processor and connect it between the channels
* on every message prepare new publisher(equivalent to `flatMap` operator)

[source,java]
.Example processing every message from channel `example-channel-1` to channel `example-channel-2`:
----
@Incoming("example-channel-1")
@Outgoing("example-channel-2")
public String processMessage(String msg) {
    return msg.toUpperCase();
}
----

[source,java]
.Example preparing processor stream to be connected between channels `example-channel-1` and `example-channel-2`:
----
@Incoming("example-channel-1")
@Outgoing("example-channel-2")
public Processor<String, String> processMessage() {
    return ReactiveStreams.<String>builder()
                .map(String::toUpperCase)
                .buildRs();
}
----

[source,java]
.Example processing every message from channel `example-channel-1`as stream to be flattened to channel `example-channel-2`:
----
@Incoming("example-channel-1")
@Outgoing("example-channel-2")
public String processMessage(String msg) {
    return ReactiveStreams.of(msg.toUpperCase(), msg.toLowerCase()).buildRs();
}
----

=== Health check

Messaging in Helidon has built in health probes for liveness and readiness. To activate it
add the <<maven-coordinates,health check dependency>>.

* Liveness - channel is considered UP until `cancel` or `onError` signal is intercepted on it.
* Readiness - channel is considered DOWN until `onSubscribe` signal is intercepted on it.

If you check your health endpoints `/health/live` and `/health/ready` you will discover
every messaging channel to have its own probe.
