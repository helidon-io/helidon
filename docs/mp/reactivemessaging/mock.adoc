== Overview
Mock connector is a simple application scoped bean that can be used for emitting to a channel
or asserting received data in a test environment. All data received are kept in memory only.

</dependency>
----

WARNING: Mock connector should be used in the test environment only!

For injecting Mock Connector use `@TestConnector` qualifier:
[source,java]
----
@Inject
@TestConnector
MockConnector mockConnector;
----

== Usage
- <<Emitting Data, Emitting Data>>
- <<Asserting Data, Asserting Data>>

=== Emitting Data

.Emitting String values `a`, `b`, `c`
[source,java]
----
mockConnector
     .incoming("my-incoming-channel", String.class) // <1>
     .emit("a", "b", "c");
----
<1> Get incoming channel of given name and payload type

=== Asserting Data

.Awaiting and asserting payloads with custom mapper
[source,java]
----
mockConnector
    .outgoing("my-outgoing-channel", String.class)           // <1>
    .awaitData(TIMEOUT, Message::getPayload, "a", "b", "c"); // <2>
----
<1> Get outgoing channel of given name and payload type
<2> Request number of expected items and block the thread until items arrive then assert the payloads

=== Configuration
|===
|Key            |Default value   | Description
|mock-data      |                | Initial data emitted to the channel immediately after subscription
|mock-data-type |java.lang.String| Type of the emitted initial data to be emitted
|===

== Helidon Test with Mock Connector
Mock connector works great with built-in Helidon test support for
link:/{rootdir}/testing/testing.adoc[JUnit 5] or link:/{rootdir}/testing/testing-ng.adoc[TestNG].

As Helidon test support makes a bean out of your test, you can inject MockConnector directly into it.

[source,java]
----
@HelidonTest
@DisableDiscovery // <1>
@AddBean(MockConnector.class) // <2>
@AddExtension(MessagingCdiExtension.class) // <3>
@AddConfig(key = "mp.messaging.incoming.test-channel-in.connector", value = MockConnector.CONNECTOR_NAME)  // <4>
@AddConfig(key = "mp.messaging.incoming.test-channel-in.mock-data-type", value = "java.lang.Integer")      // <5>
@AddConfig(key = "mp.messaging.incoming.test-channel-in.mock-data", value = "6,7,8")                       // <6>
@AddConfig(key = "mp.messaging.outgoing.test-channel-out.connector", value = MockConnector.CONNECTOR_NAME) // <7>
public class MessagingTest {

    private static final Duration TIMEOUT = Duration.ofSeconds(15);

    @Inject
    @TestConnector
    private MockConnector mockConnector; // <8>

    @Incoming("test-channel-in")
    @Outgoing("test-channel-out")
    int multiply(int payload) {  // <9>
        return payload * 10;
    }

    @Test
    void testMultiplyChannel() {
        mockConnector.outgoing("test-channel-out", Integer.TYPE) // <10>
                .awaitPayloads(TIMEOUT, 60, 70, 80);
    }
}
----

<1> If you want to add all the beans manually
<2> Manually add MockConnector bean, so it is accessible by messaging for constructing the channels
<3> Messaging support in Helidon MP is provided by this CDI extension
<4> Instruct messaging to use `mock-connector` as an upstream for channel `test-channel-in`
<5> Generate mock data of `java.lang.Integer`, String is default
<6> Generate mock data
<7> Instruct messaging to use `mock-connector` as a downstream for channel `test-channel-out`
<8> Inject mock connector so we can access publishers and subscribers registered within the mock connector
<9> Messaging processing method connecting together channels `test-channel-in` and `test-channel-out`
<10> Actual JUnit 5 test method which is going to block the thread until 3 items are intercepted on `test-channel-out`
channel's downstream and assert those with expected values.
