:feature-name: CORS

To enable CORS behavior for a resource in your Helidon MP application, you simply add the Helidon MP `@CrossOrigin`
annotation to a particular method in your resource class.

include::{common-deps-page-prefix-inc}[tag=maven-dependency]

[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.microprofile</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-microprofile-cors</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

== Understanding the `@CrossOrigin` Annotation
You set up CORS in Helidon MP using the link:{javadoc-base-url-api}/CrossOrigin.html[`@CrossOrigin`] annotation.

The following example of the `@CrossOrigin` annotation allows the resource associated with it to be shared with the origins `\http://foo.bar` and `\http://bar.foo`
using `DELETE` or `PUT`, and permits requests to include the non-standard headers `X-foo` and `X-bar`.

[source,java]
----
@CrossOrigin(value = {"http://foo.bar", "http://bar.foo"},
             allowHeaders = {"X-foo", "X-bar"},
             allowMethods = {HttpMethod.DELETE, HttpMethod.PUT})
----

== Getting Started
To add CORS support to your Helidon MP application:

1. Determine the type of cross-origin resource sharing you want to allow
 for each endpoint in your application.
2. Add a dependency on the Helidon {helidon-variant} CORS <<Maven Coordinates, artifact>>  to your Maven `pom.xml` file.

3. Edit each JAX-RS resource class in your application to add the desired CORS behavior as described in the following sections.



== Adding CORS Support to Your Helidon MP Application
Adding CORS behavior to your Helidon MP application involves two simple changes to your application code:

. For each resource and subresource in each resource class, make sure you have a Java method annotated with
`@OPTIONS` and with the correct `@Path`. Create these methods for each resource if you do not already have them.
. To each of those methods, add a `@CrossOrigin` annotation that describes the cross-origin sharing you want
for that resource.

The Helidon MP CORS implementation automatically uses the `@CrossOrigin` annotation you add to each `@OPTIONS` method to
enforce cross-origin sharing behavior for the resource identified by that method's `@Path` annotation.

For an informal look at the reasons for applying the `@CrossOrigin` annotation to the `@OPTIONS` method, instead of another
method, see <<mp/cors/hide_why-options.adoc, Why `@OPTIONS`?>>.

== Sample Application Using the `@CrossOrigin` Annotation

In the link:{quickstart-example}[Helidon MP Quickstart application] you can change the greeting by sending a `PUT`
request to the `/greet/greeting` resource.
The example below extends the Helidon MP QuickStart application (the greeting app) to:

* Permit unrestricted sharing of the resource that returns greetings, and
* Restrict sharing of the resource that
updates the greeting so that only the origins `\http://foo.com` and `\http://there.com` can change the greeting.

[source,java]
----
@OPTIONS
@CrossOrigin() // <1>
public void options() {}

@OPTIONS
@Path("/greeting")
@CrossOrigin(allowMethods = {"PUT"}, allowOrigins = {"http://foo.com", "http://there.com"}) // <2>
public void optionsForGreeting() {}
----
<1> Uses the default cross-origin sharing, which permits sharing via all HTTP methods to all origins.
<2> Specifies sharing only via the `PUT` HTTP method and only to the two listed origins.

== Next steps

* Use MicroProfile configuration to override the CORS behavior set in
the application code. <<{mp-cors-config-ref},Learn more.>>

* See the Helidon CORS support in action by building and running the link:{helidon-mp-cors-example}[CORS example].
