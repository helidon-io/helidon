include::{rootdir}/includes/mp.adoc[]

To enable CORS behavior for a resource in your Helidon MP application, you simply add the Helidon MP `@CrossOrigin`
annotation to a particular method in your resource class.

    <artifactId>helidon-microprofile-cors</artifactId>
</dependency>

== Understanding the `@CrossOrigin` Annotation
You set up CORS in Helidon MP using the link:{mp-cors-javadoc-base-url}/io/helidon/microprofile/cors/CrossOrigin.html[`@CrossOrigin`] annotation.

The following example of the `@CrossOrigin` annotation allows the resource associated with it to be shared with the origins `\http://foo.bar` and `\http://bar.foo`
using `DELETE` or `PUT`, and permits requests to include the non-standard headers `X-foo` and `X-bar`.

[source,java]
----
@CrossOrigin(value = {"http://foo.bar", "http://bar.foo"},
             allowHeaders = {"X-foo", "X-bar"},
             allowMethods = {HttpMethod.DELETE, HttpMethod.PUT})
----

== Getting Started
To add CORS support to your Helidon MP application:

1. Determine the type of cross-origin resource sharing you want to allow
 for each endpoint in your application.
2. Add a dependency on the Helidon {flavor-uc} CORS <<Maven Coordinates, artifact>>  to your Maven `pom.xml` file.

3. Edit each JAX-RS resource class in your application to add the desired CORS behavior as described in the following sections.



== Adding CORS Support to Your Helidon MP Application
Adding CORS behavior to your Helidon MP application involves three simple steps:

For reach resource class in your application:

. Identify the resources and sub resources--in other words, the paths--supported in each.
. For each of those resources and sub resources make sure you have a Java method annotated with
`@OPTIONS` and with the correct `@Path`. Create these methods for each resource (for each path) if you do not already have them.
. To each of those `@OPTIONS` methods add a `@CrossOrigin` annotation that describes the cross-origin sharing you want
for that resource.

[NOTE]
.Using @CrossOrigin Correctly
====
Use the `@CrossOrigin` annotation _only_ on methods which also have the `@OPTIONS` annotation. Remember that the `@CrossOrigin` settings apply to a given path and therefore to all Java resource methods which share that path.

Helidon MP aborts the server start-up if a resource method other than an `@OPTIONS` method has the `@CrossOrigin` annotation.
====

The Helidon MP CORS implementation automatically uses the `@CrossOrigin` annotation you add to each `@OPTIONS` method to
enforce cross-origin sharing behavior for the resource identified by that method's `@Path` annotation.

For an informal look at the reasons for applying the `@CrossOrigin` annotation to the `@OPTIONS` method, instead of another
method, see xref:hide-why-options.adoc[Why `@OPTIONS`?].

== Sample Application Using the `@CrossOrigin` Annotation

In the link:{helidon-github-tree-url}/examples/quickstarts/helidon-quickstart-mp[Helidon MP Quickstart application]
you can change the greeting by sending a `PUT` request to the `/greet/greeting` resource.
The example below extends the Helidon MP QuickStart application (the greeting app) to:

* Permit unrestricted sharing of the resource that returns greetings, and
* Restrict sharing of the resource that
updates the greeting so that only the origins `\http://foo.com` and `\http://there.com` can change the greeting.

[source,java]
----
@OPTIONS
@CrossOrigin() // <1>
public void options() {}

@OPTIONS
@Path("/greeting")
@CrossOrigin(allowMethods = {"PUT"}, allowOrigins = {"http://foo.com", "http://there.com"}) // <2>
public void optionsForGreeting() {}
----
<1> Uses the default cross-origin sharing, which permits sharing via all HTTP methods to all origins.
<2> Specifies sharing only via the `PUT` HTTP method and only to the two listed origins.

== Next steps

* Use MicroProfile configuration to override the CORS behavior set in
the application code. xref:configuration-with-cors-mp.adoc[Learn more].

* See the Helidon CORS support in action by building and running the
 link:{helidon-github-tree-url}/examples/microprofile/cors[CORS example].
