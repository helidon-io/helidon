Several built-in Helidon services -- health, metrics, and OpenAPI -- have integrated CORS support.
You can include these services in your application and control their CORS behavior.

include::{rootdir}/includes/cors.adoc[tags=configuring-cors-for-builtin-services;!se-config-example;!se-code-changes-for-builtin-services-config]

The following example restricts sharing of

* the `/health` resource, provided by the health built-in service, to only the origin `\http://there.com`, and
* the `/metrics` resource, provided by the metrics built-in service, to only the origin `\http://foo.com`.
