Your application code establishes the CORS behavior of your endpoints using the `@CrossOrigin` annotation.
You and your users can override that behavior, as well as the CORS behavior of the built-in services,
using MicroProfile configuration.

=== Understanding the Mapped Cross-Origin Configuration Format

In Helidon MP, you use
the mapped cross-origin configuration format.

// We want to use
// include::{rootdir}/includes/cors.adoc[tag=mapped-config]
// and assign an attribute for the callout 1 text. But because the MP value uses backticks for monospaced
// text, we'd have to be a little clever in the original callout. And that cleverness works when
// the document is rendered in our editors, and even when using asciidoctor to HTML, but not
// to our site.
include::{rootdir}/includes/cors.adoc[tag=mapped-config-prefix]
<1> The unique identifier for this mapped CORS config section must be `cors`.
include::{rootdir}/includes/cors.adoc[tag=mapped-config-suffix]

== Specifying Override Values in Configuration
In configuration, you can specify the same CORS-related attributes that you specify using the `@CrossOrigin` annotation.

The following example shows how you can express configuration similar to that shown
previously using the mapped cross-origin configuration format.
Here, the example uses properties-file syntax
in your application's `META-INF/microprofile-config.properties` file. Note that the top-level config key
must be `cors`.

[source,properties]
----
cors.paths.0.path-pattern = /greeting
cors.paths.0.allow-origins = http://foo.com, http://there.com, http://other.com
cors.paths.0.allow-methods = PUT, DELETE
cors.paths.1.path-pattern = /
cors.paths.1.allow-methods = GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, POST
----

NOTE: Remember that if you set configuration in a file that you include as part of your application JAR file, then you need to
rebuild and restart your application for any changes to take effect.

== Next Steps

* Use these same configuration techniques to control the behavior of the CORS-enabled
built-in services. xref:support-in-builtin-services.adoc[Learn more].

* See the Helidon CORS support in action by building and running the link:{helidon-github-tree-url}/examples/microprofile/cors[CORS example].
