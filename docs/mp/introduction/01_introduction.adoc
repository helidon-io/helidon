= Helidon MP Introduction
:description: about Helidon MP
:keywords: helidon, java, microservices, microprofile
:h1Prefix: MP

Helidon MP is an Eclipse MicroProfile runtime that allows the Jakarta EE community to run microservices in a portable way.


== About Helidon MP Components

Helidon MP {helidon-version} is an implementation of the
https://microprofile.io[MicroProfile]
https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile/releases[specification] and supports MicroProfile {mp-version}. Since
MicroProfile has its roots in Java EE, the MicroProfile
APIs follow a familiar, declarative approach with heavy use of annotations.
This makes it a good choice for Java EE developers. 

Helidon has added additional APIs to the core set of Microprofile APIs giving you all the capabilities you need for writing modern cloud native applications.
