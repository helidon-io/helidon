= About Helidon MP
:description: about Helidon MP
:keywords: helidon, java, microservices, microprofile

== Helidon MP

Helidon is a collection of Java libraries for writing microservices. Helidon
offers two programming models: <<se/introduction/01_introduction.adoc,Helidon SE>>
and Helidon MP.

Helidon MP is an implementation of the
https://microprofile.io[MicroProfile]
https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile/releases[specification].
Helidon {helidon-version} supports MicroProfile {mp-version}. Since
MicroProfile has its roots in Java EE, you'll find that the MicroProfile
APIs follow a familiar, declarative approach with heavy use of annotations.
This makes it a good choice for Java EE developers.

== MicroProfile APIs

MicroProfile starts with a core of Java EE APIs, then defines a number
of new APIs to add capabilities you need for writing modern cloud native
applications:

* JAX-RS
* JSON-P
* JSON-B
* CDI
* MicroProfile Config
* MicroProfile Fault Tolerance
* MicroProfile Health
* MicroProfile JWT Authentication
* MicroProfile Metrics
* MicroProfile OpenAPI
* MicroProfile OpenTracing
* MicroProfile Rest Client

For more information see <<mp/guides/01_overview.adoc,guides>>.

== Helidon MP CDI Extensions

In addition to MicroProfile support, Helidon MP provides
<<mp/extensions/01_overview.adoc,CDI extensions>> to address areas not
covered by MicroProfile. Examples include:

* DataSource for Oracle UCP and HikariCP
* JPA
* JTA
* Jedis
* OCI Object storage

== No Application Server

Helidon is a collection of libraries that runs on top of Netty. It is not
derived from a Java EE application server. That means your cloud native
application is compact
and efficient without unnecessary overhead or bloat.

first Helidon MP application up and running in minutes.
