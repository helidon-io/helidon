This https://docs.jboss.org/cdi/spec/2.0/cdi-spec.html#spi[CDI
portable extension] provides support for JTA (Java Transaction API)
transactions in your Helidon MicroProfile applications.

== Declaring a method to be transactional

The following example shows how to declare a transactional method.

[source,java]
.Transactional method declaration
----
@Transactional(Transactional.TxType.REQUIRED)
public void doSomethingTransactionally() {

}
----

The extension ensures that a transaction is started before and
committed after the method executes.  If the method throws an
exception, the transaction will be rolled back.

You can further specify the transactional behavior of the extension by
using different instances of the `Transactional` annotation.  For more
information, see the
https://static.javadoc.io/javax.transaction/javax.transaction-api/1.2/javax/transaction/Transactional.html[`Transactional`
annotation documentation].

Transactional method support is implemented by CDI interception
facilities.  Among other things, this means that the method to which
you apply the `Transactional` annotation must not be `private` and
must in all other ways be a _business method_.  See the
https://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/mrel/jsr318/index3.html[Java
Interceptors specification] for more details.

During a transactional method invocation, the extension makes the
following objects available for injection via the `Inject` annotation:
