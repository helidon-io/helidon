= Helidon MP Upgrade Guide

:description: Helidon MP Upgrade Guide
:keywords: helidon, porting, migration, upgrade, incompatibilities
:helidon-uc-flavor: MP
:helidon-lc-flavor: mp

In Helidon 2 we have made some changes to APIs and runtime behavior. This guide
will help you migrate a Helidon MP 1.x application to 2.x.

include::../../common/guides/migration.adoc[]

== MicroProfile Bundles

We have removed the versioned MicroProfile bundles (i.e. `helidon-microprofile-x.x`), and introduced
unversioned core and full bundles:

- `io.helidon.microprofile.bundles:helidon-microprofile-core` - contains only MP Server
   and Config. Allows you to add only the specifications needed by your application.
- `io.helidon.microprofile.bundles:helidon-microprofile` - contains the latest full
   MicroProfile version implemented by Helidon

== Application Main and Startup

* `io.helidon.microprofile.server.Main` has been deprecated. Use `io.helidon.microprofile.cdi.Main` instead.
* `io.helidon.microprofile.server.Server` is still available, although the features are much reduced.
* You no longer need to initialize Java Util Logging explicitly. Put `logging.properties` on the classpath
  or in the current directory to be automatically picked up to configure Java Util Logging.

== JAX-RS Applications

Helidon 1.x usually required that you have an `Application` subclass that returned
the Application classes to scan. For common cases this is no longer necessary, and you
might be able to remove your `Application` class.

JAX-RS applications now work similarly to how they work in application servers:

* if there is an `Application` subclass that returns anything from `getClasses` or `getSingletons`, it is used as is
* if there is an `Application` subclass that returns empty sets from these methods, all available resource classes will be part of such an application
* if there is no `Application` subclass, a synthetic application will be created with all available resource classes
* `Application` subclasses MUST be annotated with `@ApplicationScoped`, otherwise they are ignored

== MicroProfile JWT-Auth

If a JAX-RS application exists that is annotated with `@LoginConfig` with value MP-JWT,
the correct authentication provider is added to security. The startup would fail if the provider is required yet not configured.

== Security in Helidon MP

* If there is no authentication provider configured, authentication will now fail.
* If there is no authorization provider configured, the ABAC provider will be configured.

In Helidon 1.x these were configured if there was no provider configured overall.

== CDI and MicroProfile Server

In order to support GraalVM `native-image` we have had to re-implement how CDI is initialized
and started. This has resulted in some changes in APIs and behavior:

* You can no longer start the CDI container yourself.
* You can only run a single instance of Server in a JVM.
* If you use `SeContainerInitializer` you will get an exception.
  ** This can be worked around by configuration property `mp.initializer.allow=true`, and warning can
     be removed using `mp.initializer.no-warn=true`
  ** Once `SeContainerInitializer` is used you can no longer use MP with `native-image`
* You can no longer provide a `Context` instance. The root context is now built-in.
* `MpService` and `MpServiceContext` have been removed.
  ** Methods from context have been moved to `JaxRsCdiExtension` and `ServerCdiExtension`.
  These can be accessed from CDI extension through `BeanManager.getExtension`.
  ** Methods `register` can be used on current `io.helidon.context.Context`
  ** `MpService` equivalent is a CDI extension. All Helidon services were refactored to
      CDI extension (you can use these for reference).
* `Server.cdiContainer` is removed, use `CDI.current()` instead.


== Metrics

Helidon now supports only MicroProfile Metrics 2.x. Support for Metrics 1.x has been removed,
and modules for 2.x have been renamed from `metrics2` to `metrics`.

== Java EE dependencies
We have moved from dependencies in groupId `javax` (Java EE modules) to dependencies
in groupId `jakarta` (Jakarta EE modules).

In case you declared a dependency on a javax module, you should change it to a jakarta one.

Example:
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>javax.activation</groupId>
    <artifactId>javax.activation-api</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

should be changed to
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>jakarta.activation</groupId>
    <artifactId>jakarta.activation-api</artifactId>
</dependency>
----
As the `javax` module is no longer in dependency management of Helidon parent pom files.
