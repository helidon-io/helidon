In Helidon 3.x we have made some changes to APIs and runtime behavior. This guide
will help you migrate a Helidon MP 2.x application to 3.x.


== Java 17 Runtime

Java 11 is no longer supported in Helidon 3. Java 17 or newer is required.


== javax.* namespace to jakarta.* namespace

Due to trademark restrictions imposed on the javax.* namespace, Jakarta EE will rename all of its specifications to use jakarta.* in order to move forward with evolving the platform with features as the cloud-native Java platform.
In version 3.x Helidon supports MicroProfile 5 specification, which now is fully migrated to `jakarta.x` namespace.

As the `javax` module is no longer in dependency management of Helidon parent pom files.


== MicroProfile 5 support

MicroProfile 5 enables MicroProfile APIs to be used together with Jakarta EE 9.1 (Jakarta EE namespace). This release was mainly focused on updating dependencies from `javax` to `jakarta`, as well as overall stability and usability improvements.

MicroProfile 5 lays the foundation for the rapid innovation of MicroProfile APIs  for its 2022 releases.

Microprofile 5 is an umbrella for the following specifications and their corresponding versions:

* MicroProfile Config {version-lib-microprofile-config}
* MicroProfile Fault Tolerance {version-lib-microprofile-fault-tolerance-api}
* MicroProfile Health {version-lib-microprofile-health}
* MicroProfile JWT Authentication {version-lib-microprofile-jwt}
* MicroProfile Metrics {version-lib-microprofile-metrics-api}
* MicroProfile OpenAPI {version-lib-microprofile-openapi-api}
* MicroProfile OpenTracing {version-lib-microprofile-tracing}
* MicroProfile Rest Client {version-lib-microprofile-rest-client}

Helidon 3.x is Passing the 5 Jakarta Specification TCKs:

* CDI (Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection) {version-lib-jakarta-cdi}
* JAX-RS (Jakarta RESTful Web Services) {version-lib-jakarta-jaxrs-api}
* JSON-B (Jakarta JSON Binding) {version-lib-jakarta-jsonb-api}
* JSON-P (Jakarta JSON Processing) {version-lib-jakarta-jsonp-api}
* Jakarta Annotations {version-lib-jakarta-annotations-api}

Corresponding changes to Helidon code were made to support the corresponding specifications' versions.


== Updated CLI
