== Overview

Helidon supports Bean Validation via its integration with JAX-RS/Jersey. The
{jakarta-bean-validation-spec-url}[Jakarta Bean Validation specification] defines an API to validate Java beans.
Bean Validation is supported in REST resource classes as well as in regular application beans.

If bean validation is required outside JAX-RS/Jersey use cases, it is also available in Helidon.
It follows the standard {jakarta-bean-validation-spec-url}[Jakarta Bean Validation specification] which defines an API to validate Java beans.

== API

The specification defines a small set of built-in constraints. Their usage is encouraged both in regular constraint declarations and as composing constraints. Using this set of constraints will enhance portability of your constraints across constraint-consuming frameworks relying on the metadata API (such as client side validation frameworks or database schema generation frameworks).

Built-in annotations are annotated with an empty `@Constraint` annotation to avoid any dependency between the specification API and a specific implementation. Each Jakarta Bean Validation provider must recognize built-in constraint annotations as valid constraint definitions and provide compliant constraint implementations for each. The built-in constraint validation implementation is having a lower priority than an XML mapping definition. In other words ConstraintValidator implementations for built-in constraints can be overridden by using the XML mapping (see Overriding constraint definitions in XML).

All built-in constraints are in the `jakarta.validation.constraints` package. Here is the list of constraints and their declaration.

== Configuration

Bean Validation can be configured using `META-INF/validation.xml`.

For more information about configuring the validator factory in validation.xml, see link:https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/validator/reference/en-US/html_single/?v=7.0#chapter-xml-configuration[Hibernate Validator Documentation].

== Examples

1. The following example shows a simple resource method annotated with `@POST` whose
parameter must be _not null_ and _valid_. Validating a parameter in this case implies
making sure that any constraint annotations in the `Greeting` class are satisfied.
The resource method shall never be called if the validation fails, with a 400
(Bad Request) status code returned instead.
+
[source,java]
----
@Path("helloworld")
public class HelloWorld {

    @POST
    @Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    public void post(@NotNull @Valid Greeting greeting) {
        // ...
    }
}
----

2. The following example shows a simple application with one field declared as _not null_ using `@NotNull` annotation:
+
[source,java]
----
public class GreetingHolder {
    @NotNull
    private String greeting;
    //...
}
----
+
If the bean contains a method parameter annotated with @Valid, and GreetingHolder with _null_greeting is passed, then a _ValidationException_ will be thrown:
+
[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class GreetingProvider {
    private GreetingHolder greetingHolder;
    //..
    void setGreeting(@Valid GreetingHolder greetingHolder) {
        this.greetingHolder = greetingHolder;
    }
}
----
+
NOTE: `beans.xml` is required to identify beans and for bean validation to work properly.

== Additional Information

Helidon uses link:https://hibernate.org/validator/[Hibernate Bean Validator] for general bean validation.
