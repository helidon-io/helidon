== Overview [[Overview]]

Helidon MP comes with deep integration for three
specification-defined, broadly persistence-related technologies that
can be used together or separately:

Each integration's setup, configuration, and usage are described
below.

=== Overview [[DS-Overview]]    

Helidon MP's named data source integration allows you to safely inject
managed
link:{jdk-javadoc-url}/java.sql/javax/sql/DataSource.html[`javax.sql.DataSource`]
instances that are annotated with
link:{jakarta-inject-javadoc-url}/jakarta/inject/named[`jakarta.inject.Named`
annotations] into your Helidon MP application.
link:{jdk-javadoc-url}/java.sql/java/sql/Connection.html[`java.sql.Connection`
objects]
link:{jdk-javadoc-url}/java.sql/javax/sql/DataSource.html#getConnection()[acquired]
from these data sources will be pooled by your choice of one of two
possible connection pool implementations.

The connections managed by the connection pool will be supplied by
your relational database vendor's JDBC driver.

How you set up Helidon MP's named data source integration differs
depending on which of these two connection pools, which JDBC driver,
and which relational database product you use.

Representative setups are described below.  The list of such setups is
not exhaustive.

===== Overview [[DS-CP-Overview]]

Helidon MP's named data source integration requires a connection pool
implementation.

Helidon MP comes with support for two connection
pools:

1. https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP[HikariCP]

2. link:{oracle-ucp-doc-base-url}/index.html[Oracle Universal
   Connection Pool]

You can choose to use either, but not both.

Details concerning each connection pool's setup are described below.

* <<DS-Driver-Project-Setup-Overview, Overview>>
* <<DS-H2-Driver-Project-Setup, Setting Up H2>>
* <<DS-Oracle-Driver-Project-Setup, Setting Up the Oracle JDBC Drivers>>


===== Overview [[DS-Driver-Project-Setup-Overview]]

Regardless of which connection pool you use, at the lowest level JDBC
database driver classes are responsible for making any connections to
a relational database.  JDBC database driver classes are
database-product-specific.

Once you have decided upon a relational database product to use, and
JDBC driver classes to use to connect to it,
xref:../about/managing-dependencies.adoc[ensure your dependencies are
managed], and then ensure that a `runtime`-scoped `<dependency>`
element describing your JDBC driver classes is present as a child
element of your project's `pom.xml` file's `<dependencies>` element.

See the
link:{jdk-javadoc-url}/java.sql/java/sql/package-summary.html[JDBC 4.3
Specification] for more information about JDBC.

=== Configuration [[DS-Configuration]]

==== Overview [[DS-Configuration-Overview]]

Each connection pool supported by Helidon's named data source
integration support is, itself, a `DataSource` that wraps a
_vendor-supplied_ `DataSource` present in the JDBC driver classes you
added to your project.  You must configure both the pool and the
vendor-supplied `DataSource`.

To configure Helidon MP's named data source integration:

1. Decide where each property of the configuration will reside, as
   permitted by xref:config/introduction.adoc[Helidon MP's
   MicroProfile Config implementation]

2. Create configuration suitable for the combination of your selected
   connection pool and your selected vendor-supplied `DataSource`
   implementation in those locations

Helidon MP's named data source integration relies on
xref:config/introduction.adoc[Helidon MP's usage of MicroProfile
Config], so you have many choices for each configuration property when
deciding on your configuration's location in (1) above.

The configuration property values themselves are necessarily specific
to the connection pool you selected, and to the vendor-supplied
`DataSource` responsible for actually connecting to your relational
database.  In general, at a minimum, in your configuration you
typically supply:

* Information so the connection pool knows which vendor-supplied
  `DataSource` implementation to manage

* A JDBC URL specific to the vendor-supplied `DataSource` describing
  where the database is located, so the managed vendor-supplied
  `DataSource` knows how to connect to it

* Information required for the vendor-supplied `DataSource` to
  authenticate to the database and otherwise tailor itself to it

Some examples for representative configurations follow.  The list of
such configurations is not exhaustive.

==== Configuration Prefixes [[DS-Configuration-Prefixes]]

All MicroProfile Config-compatible property names for Helidon MP's
named data source integration follow a common pattern:

[example]
*_objecttype_*.*_datasourcename_*.*_propertyname_*

* The name of a given configuration property always begins with the
  *_objecttype_* portion: a fully-qualified Java class name of the
  object being configured.  Configuration for Helidon MP's named
  data source integration concerns the behavior of
  `javax.sql.DataSource` objects, so Helidon MP's named data source
  integration configuration property names begin with
  `javax.sql.DataSource`.

** A period (`.`) separates the _objecttype_ portion from the rest of
   the property name.

* The *_datasourcename_* portion, the name of the data source being
  configured, comes next.  It cannot contain a period (`.`).

** A period (`.`) separates the _datasourcename_ portion from the rest
   of the property name.

* The *_propertyname_* portion, identifying the connection-pool- or
  vendor-supplied-`DataSource`-specific configuration property name,
  comes last.  It may contain periods (`.`).

As an example, configuration to set an imaginary `foo.bar` property on
the `test` data source's associated connection pool or vendor-specific
`DataSource` to `baz` looks like this in Java `.properties` format:

[source,properties]
----
javax.sql.DataSource.test.foo.bar=baz # <1> <2> <3>
----
<1> The *_objecttype_* portion of the configuration property name is
    `javax.sql.DataSource`.
<2> The *_datasourcename_* portion of the configuration property name
    is `test`.
<3> The *_propertyname_* portion of the configuration property name is
    `foo.bar`.

==== Examples [[DS-Configuration-Examples]]

Here are some examples illustrating general named data source
configuration patterns in various
xref:config/advanced-configuration.adoc[common MicroProfile
Config-compatible locations].

===== Example: `META-INF/microprofile-config.properties` Classpath Resource

Here is an example of some named data source configuration as might be
found in a
`src/main/resources/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties`
configuration source:

[source,properties]
----
javax.sql.DataSource.yourDataSourceName.somePropertyOfYourConnectionPoolAndDataSource = itsValue
javax.sql.DataSource.yourDataSourceName.someOtherPropertyOfYourConnectionPoolAndDataSource = anotherValue
----

===== Example: System Properties Set on the Command Line

Here is an example of some named data source configuration using
system properties on the command line instead:

[source,bash]
----
java \
  -Djavax.sql.DataSource.yourDataSourceName.somePropertyOfYourConnectionPoolAndDataSource=itsValue \
  -Djavax.sql.DataSource.yourDataSourceName.someOtherPropertyOfYourConnectionPoolAndDataSource=anotherValue \
  # ...
----

===== Example: Environment Variables Set on the Command Line

Here is an example of some named data source configuration using
environment variables as typed directly into a command line shell,
relying on
link:{microprofile-config-javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/microprofile/config/spi/ConfigSource.html#default_config_sources[MicroProfile
Config's mapping rules], since many shells will not understand
environment variable names with periods (.)  in them:

[source,bash]
----
JAVAX_SQL_DATASOURCE_YOURDATASOURCENAME_SOMEPROPERTYOFYOURCONNECTIONPOOLANDDATASOURCE=itsValue \
JAVAX_SQL_DATASOURCE_YOURDATASOURCENAME_SOMEOTHERPROPERTYOFYOURCONNECTIONPOOLANDDATASOURCE=anotherValue \
java # ...
----

===== Example: Environment Variables Set By the `env` Command

Here is an example of some named data source configuration using
environment variables as supplied via the
https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/env-invocation.html[`env`
shell command], thus removing the need for
link:{microprofile-config-javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/microprofile/config/spi/ConfigSource.html#default_config_sources[MicroProfile
Config's mapping rules]:

[source,bash]
----
env 'javax.sql.DataSource.yourDataSourceName.somePropertyOfYourConnectionPoolAndDataSource=itsValue' \
  'javax.sql.DataSource.yourDataSourceName.someOtherPropertyOfYourConnectionPoolAndDataSource=anotherValue' \
  java # ...
----

===== Example: `application.yaml` Classpath Resource

Here is an example of some named data source configuration as might be
found in a `src/main/resources/application.yaml` classpath resource:

[source,yaml]
----
javax:
  sql:
    DataSource:
      yourDataSourceName:
        somePropertyOfYourConnectionPoolAndDataSource: itsValue
        someOtherPropertyOfYourConnectionPoolAndDataSource: anotherValue
----

===== Example: Configuring the Oracle Universal Connection Pool and Oracle JDBC [[DS-Configuration-UCP-Oracle-Example]]

This example presumes you have:

* <<DS-UCP-Project-Setup,Set up the Oracle Universal Connection Pool>>

* <<DS-Oracle-Driver-Project-Setup,Set up Oracle JDBC>>

This example, in Java properties file format, configures an Oracle
Universal Connection Pool-managed data source named `main` to
link:{oracle-jdbc-doc-base-url}/data-sources-and-URLs.html#GUID-C4F2CA86-0F68-400C-95DA-30171C9FB8F0[connect
to an Oracle Database] on `localhost` port `1521`, using the
`oracle.jdbc.poolOracleDataSource` vendor-supplied `DataSource`, with
a service name of `XE`, a `user` of `scott`, and a `password` of
`tiger`:

[source,properties]
----
javax.sql.DataSource.main.connectionFactoryClassName = oracle.jdbc.pool.OracleDataSource # <1>
javax.sql.DataSource.main.url = jdbc:oracle:thin://@localhost:1521/XE # <2>
javax.sql.DataSource.main.user = scott
javax.sql.DataSource.main.password = tiger
----
<1> Why `connectionFactoryClassName`? See
    link:{oracle-ucp-javadoc-base-url}/oracle/ucp/jdbc/PoolDataSourceImpl.html#setConnectionFactoryClassName_java_lang_String_)[`PoolDataSourceImpl#setConnectionFactoryClassName(String)`].
<2> See
    link:{oracle-jdbc-doc-base-url}/data-sources-and-URLs.html#GUID-EF07727C-50AB-4DCE-8EDC-57F0927FF61A[Thin-style
    Service Name Syntax].

In general, the properties that can be set on the Oracle Universal
Connection Pool can be inferred from the "setter" methods found in
link:{oracle-ucp-javadoc-base-url}/oracle/ucp/jdbc/PoolDataSourceImpl.html[the
javadoc for the `PoolDataSourceImpl` class].

In general, the properties that can be set on the
link:{oracle-jdbc-javadoc-base-url}/oracle/jdbc/pool/OracleDataSource.html[`oracle.jdbc.pool.OracleDataSource`]
`DataSource` implementation can be inferred from the "setter" methods
found in
link:{oracle-jdbc-javadoc-base-url}/oracle/jdbc/pool/OracleDataSource.html[its
javadoc].

NOTE: link:{hikaricp-base-url}/src/main/java/com/zaxxer/hikari/util/PropertyElf.java#L46-L53[Unlike
HikariCP], the Oracle Universal Connection Pool does not distinguish
cleanly between configuration properties that affect _its_ behavior
and those that affect the behavior of the vendor-supplied `DataSource`
implementation whose connections it pools.  For example, in the
example above it is not possible to tell that
link:{oracle-ucp-javadoc-base-url}/oracle/ucp/jdbc/PoolDataSourceImpl.html#setConnectionFactoryClassName_java_lang_String_[`connectionFactoryClassName`
is a property of the Oracle Universal Connection Pool], and
link:{oracle-jdbc-javadoc-base-url}/oracle/jdbc/datasource/impl/OracleDataSource.html#setUser_java_lang_String_[`user`
is a property of the `oracle.jdbc.pool.OracleDataSource` `DataSource`
implementation].  In some cases, the Oracle Universal Connection Pool
will
link:{oracle-ucp-javadoc-base-url}/oracle/ucp/jdbc/PoolDataSource.html#setUser_java_lang_String_[set
the given property on _both_ the connection pool itself _and_ on the
vendor-supplied `DataSource` it manages].

===== Example: Configuring the HikariCP Connection Pool and H2 [[DS-Configuration-HikariCP-H2-Example]]

This example presumes you have:

* <<DS-HikariCP-Project-Setup,Set up the HikariCP connection pool>>

* <<DS-H2-Driver-Project-Setup,Set up H2>>

This example, in Java properties file format, configures a
HikariCP-managed data source named `test` to connect to an in-memory
H2 database named `unit-testing` with a `user` of `sa` and an empty
password:

[source,properties]
----
javax.sql.DataSource.test.dataSourceClassName = org.h2.jdbcx.JdbcDataSource # <1>
javax.sql.DataSource.test.dataSource.url = jdbc:h2:mem:unit-testing;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1 # <2> <3>
javax.sql.DataSource.test.dataSource.user = sa
javax.sql.DataSource.test.dataSource.password =
----
<1> Why `dataSourceClassName`? See
    https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP#essentials[HikariCP's
    configuration documentation] for information about how HikariCP
    separates configuration of the connection pool itself from
    configuration of the vendor-supplied `DataSource`.
<2> Why `dataSource.`? See
    link:{hikaricp-base-url}/src/main/java/com/zaxxer/hikari/util.PropertyElf.java#L47-49[`PropertyElf.java`,
    lines 47–49].
<3> See https://www.h2database.com/html/features.html#database_url[the
    H2 database's documentation about its URL format].

HikariCP's configuration properties are described
https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP#gear-configuration-knobs-baby[on
its Github repository].  Properties that should be forwarded on to the
vendor-supplied `DataSource`
link:{hikaricp-base-url}/src/main/java/com/zaxxer/hikari/util/PropertyElf.java#L46-L53[are
prefixed with `dataSource.`] as seen in the example above.

In general, the properties that can be set on the
https://www.h2database.com/javadoc/org/h2/jdbcx/JdbcDataSource.html[`org.h2.jdbcx.JdbcDataSource`]
vendor-supplied `DataSource` can be inferred from the "setter" methods
found in
https://www.h2database.com/javadoc/org/h2/jdbcx/JdbcDataSource.html[its
javadoc].

=== Usage [[DS-Usage]]

You use Helidon MP's named data source integration in the same way,
regardless of your choices of vendor-supplied `DataSource` and
connection pool.

To use Helidon MP's named data source integration in your application,
once it has been <<DS-Setup,set up>> and
<<DS-Configuration,configured>>, create an ordinary
link:{jdk-javadoc-url}/java.sql/javax/sql/DataSource.html[`DataSource`]-typed
injection point in a
https://github.com/oracle/helidon/wiki/FAQ#how-do-i-make-a-class-a-cdi-bean[Java
class representing a CDI bean] somewhere in your application,
link:{jakarta-inject-javadoc-url}/jakarta/inject/named[annotated with
the name] of the data source you wish to use.

Here is how to define such a field-backed injection point:

[source,java]
----
import javax.sql.DataSource;

import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import jakarta.inject.Named;

// ...

@Inject // <1>
@Named("test") // <2>
private DataSource ds; // <3>
----
<1> link:{jakarta-inject-javadoc-url}/jakarta/inject/inject[`@Inject`]
    marks the field as an injection point.  Its behavior is defined by
    the link:{jakarta-inject-spec-url}[Jakarta Dependency Injection
    specification].
<2> link:{jakarta-inject-javadoc-url}/jakarta/inject/named[`@Named("test")`]
    says to use the data source named `test` (as declared by the
    <<DS-Configuration-Prefixes, _datasourcename_ portion>> of a named
    data source configuration property).
<3> The field injection point has a type of
    link:{jdk-javadoc-url}/java.sql/javax/sql/DataSource.html[`javax.sql.DataSource`],
    and the field itselfmay be named anything you like.

Here is how to define such a constructor parameter injection point:

[source,java]
----
import javax.sql.DataSource;

import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import jakarta.inject.Named;

// ...

private final DataSource ds; // <1>

@Inject // <2>
public SomeObject(@Named("test") DataSource ds) { // <3>
    this.ds = ds; // <4>
}
----
<1> This is the field whose value will be set in the constructor.
<2> link:{jakarta-inject-javadoc-url}/jakarta/inject/inject[`@Inject`]
    marks the constructor as one containing parameter injection
    points.  Its behavior is defined by the
    link:{jakarta-inject-spec-url}[Jakarta Dependency Injection
    specification].
<3> link:{jakarta-inject-javadoc-url}/jakarta/inject/named[`@Named("test")`]
    says to use the data source named `test` (as declared by the
    <<DS-Configuration-Prefixes, _datasourcename_ portion>> of a named
    data source configuration property).  The parameter injection
    point has a type of
    link:{jdk-javadoc-url}/java.sql/javax/sql/DataSource.html[`javax.sql.DataSource`],
    and the parameter itself may be named anything you like.

<4> The injected argument will never be `null`.

=== Overview [[JTA-Overview]]

Helidon MP's Jakarta Transactions integration integrates the
https://www.narayana.io/[Naryana transaction engine], an
implementation of the link:{jakarta-transactions-base-url}/[Jakarta
Transactions Specification], into Helidon MP.  It lets you use
link:{jakarta-transactions-javadoc-url}/jakarta/transaction/transactional[`@jakarta.transaction.Transactional`]
to declare JTA transactions in your Java code.

=== Maven Coordinates (JTA) [[JTA-Maven-Coordinates]]

To include Helidon's JTA integration in your application:

* xref:../about/managing-dependencies.adoc[Ensure your dependencies are
managed]

* Ensure the following `<dependency>` elements are present as child
  elements of your project's `pom.xml` file's `<dependencies>` element:
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>jakarta.transaction</groupId>
    <artifactId>jakarta.transaction-api</artifactId>
    <scope>provided</scope> <!--1-->
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.integrations.cdi</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-integrations-cdi-jta-weld</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope> <!--2-->
</dependency>
----
<1> The `scope` is `provided`, which ensures that the
    link:{jakarta-transactions-javadoc-url}/jakarta/transaction/transactional[JTA
    classes required for compilation] are available at compile time.
<2> The implementation of these API classes (provided by
    https://narayana.io/[Narayana]) will be available at runtime.

=== Configuration [[JTA-Configuration]]

==== Overview [[JTA-Configuration-Overview]]

Helidon MP's Jakarta Transactions integration does not require
configuration, but configuration is possible.  Because configuration
is of the https://narayana.io/[underlying Narayana transaction
engine], any restrictions are those of the engine, not of Helidon
itself.

Narayana, unlike Helidon MP, does not use MicroProfile Config, so its
configuration options are less flexible.

Some common examples of Narayana configuration follow.

==== Configuring the Object Store Directory

Narayana features an object store directory which it uses to store
information about transaction outcomes.  To set its location, you may
set the
https://www.narayana.io/docs/api/com/arjuna/ats/arjuna/common/ObjectStoreEnvironmentBean.html#setObjectStoreType-java.lang.String-[`ObjectStoreEnvironmentBean.objectStoreDir`]
system property to the full path of a writeable directory:

[source,bash]
----
java -DObjectStoreEnvironmentBean.objectStoreDir=/var/tmp # ...
----

See https://www.narayana.io/docs/project/index.html#d0e4013[Specifying
the object store location] for more information.

==== Configuring the Default Transaction Manager Timeout

To configure Narayana's
https://www.narayana.io/docs/api/com/arjuna/ats/arjuna/common/CoordinatorEnvironmentBean.html#setDefaultTimeout-int-[default
transaction manager timeout], set the
`com.arjuna.ats.arjuna.coordinator.defaultTimeout` system property to
an integral value in seconds:

[source,bash]
----
java -Dcom.arjuna.ats.arjuna.coordinator.defaultTimeout=60 # ...
----

For more on configuring Narayana, see
https://www.narayana.io/docs/project/index.html#chap-JBossJTA_Installation_Guide-Test_Chapter[Setting
Properties] in the Naryana documentation.

=== Usage [[JTA-Usage]]

To use Helidon MP's Jakarta Transactions integration, annotate a
method with the
link:{jakarta-transactions-javadoc-url}/jakarta/transaction/transactional[`jakarta.transaction.Transactional`]
annotation:

[source,java]
----
import jakarta.transaction.Transactional;

// ...

@Transactional // <1>
public String getGreeting(Integer id) {
  // Use a JTA-aware facility to do something transactional here. <2>
}
----
<1> The
    link:{jakarta-transactions-javadoc-url}/jakarta/transaction/transactional[`@Transactional`

=== Overview [[JPA-Overview]]

Helidon MP's link:{jakarta-persistence-base-url}/[Jakarta Persistence]
integration allows you to interact with Jakarta Persistence (JPA)
objects as if your code were running in an application server,
handling automatic creation and management of objects such as
`EntityManager` and `EntityManagerFactory` instances.

More pragmatically, it allows you to inject managed
link:{jakarta-persistence-javadoc-url}/jakarta.persistence/jakarta/persistence/entitymanager[`EntityManager`]
instances using the
link:{jakarta-persistence-javadoc-url}/jakarta.persistence/jakarta/persistence/persistencecontext[`@PersistenceContext`]
annotation.

Jakarta Persistence is a Jakarta EE specification that describes,
among other things, how it is implemented:

1. Map Java objects to relational database tables

2. Manage such persistent Java objects

3. Interact with <<JTA, Jakarta Transactions>>

4. Interact with <<DS, named data sources>>

Jakarta Persistence may be used in an entirely application-managed
manner, which requires no integration at all.  This
application-managed mode places the burden of error handling, thread
safety, transaction management, and other concerns on the user.
**This documentation does _not_ cover application-managed mode JPA.**

Jakarta Persistence may also (preferably) be used in a fully
container-managed manner, which requires that a container, like
Helidon MP, handle error management, thread safety and transaction
management on behalf of the user.  **This documentation covers this
container-managed mode of JPA exclusively.**

Helidon MP's Jakarta Persistence integration comes with support for
two JPA implementations, known as _JPA providers_:

1. link:{hibernate-doc-base-url}[Hibernate ORM]

2. https://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink/documentation/[Eclipselink]

In any given project, you use one or the other, but not both.

How you set up Helidon MP's Jakarta Persistence integration differs
depending on which of these JPA providers you choose to use.

Jakarta Persistence requires <<JTA, Jakarta Transactions>> and makes
use of <<DS, named data sources>>, so as you set up your project you
will need to understand:

* <<DS, Helidon MP's named data source integration>>

* <<JTA, Helidon MP's Jakarta Transactions integration>>

===== Overview [[JPA-Setup-Overview]]

While the Jakarta Persistence specification standardizes many aspects
around programming and usage, it deliberately leaves many required
setup and configuration aspects up to the JPA provider.  You will need
to set up your project differently depending on which JPA provider you
choose.

To set up Helidon MP's Jakarta Persistence integration in your
application to work with your chosen JPA provider, you must:

1. <<DS, Set up and configure named data sources as appropriate>>

2. <<JTA, Set up and configure Helidon MP's Jakarta Transactions
   support>>

3. Include the proper Jakarta Persistence-related dependencies

4. Set up your project to generate and compile the
   link:{jakarta-persistence-spec-url}#a6933[static metamodel]

5. Set up your project for _static weaving_

Details and examples for each supported JPA provider are below.

===== Maven Coordinates (Common) [[JPA-Maven-Coordinates]]

To include the Jakarta Persistence APIs that you will need and to
include the core of Helidon's Jakarta Persistence integration:

  are managed]

* <<DS, Ensure you have set up and configured named data sources as
  appropriate>>

* <<JTA, Ensure you have set up and configured Helidon MP's Jakarta
  Transactions support>>

* Ensure the following `<dependency>` elements are present as child
  elements of your project's `pom.xml` file's `<dependencies>` element:

    provider-independent Jakarta Persistence integration is available at
    runtime.

These `<dependency>` elements do not set up a JPA provider.  See
details below for the JPA provider you have chosen to use.

===== Setting Up Static Metamodel Generation [[JPA-MetaModel]]

To generate and compile the Jakarta Persistence static metamodel for
your application, regardless of whether you are using Hibernate ORM or
Eclipselink, make sure the `<plugin>` element in the following code
snippet is present as a child element of the
`<pluginManagement><plugins>` element sequence as shown below:

https://wiki.eclipse.org/EclipseLink/UserGuide/JPA/Advanced_JPA_Development/Performance/Weaving/Static_Weaving#Use_the_Command_Line[Static
Weaving] in the Eclipselink documentation.

=== Configuration [[JPA-Configuration]]

To configure Helidon MP's Jakarta Persistence integration, you author
a
link:{jakarta-persistence-spec-url}#persistence-xml-file[`src/main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml`
file].  It contains a mix of standardized elements and JPA
provider-specific properties.

For details about the structure and syntax of the
`META-INF/persistence.xml` file, see
link:{jakarta-persistence-spec-url}#persistence-xml-file[persistence.xml
file] in the Jakarta Persistence specification.

Fundamentally, a `META-INF/persistence.xml` file contains a collection
of _persistence units_.  A persistence unit represents a collection of
entities in a relational database loosely coupled to a <<DS, named
data source>> that knows how to connect to it.

Your `src/main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml` file must begin
(and end) with the following XML:

.`src/main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml`
[source,xml]
----
<persistence xmlns="https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence"
             xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
             xsi:schemaLocation="https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence
                                 https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence/persistence_3_0.xsd"
             version="3.0"> <!--1-->

    <!--2-->

</persistence>
----
<1> Helidon MP's Jakarta Persistence integration supports
    link:{jakarta-persistence-base-url}/[Jakarta Persistence version
    3.0].
<2> `<persistence-unit> elements are listed here.

==== Persistence Unit

* <<Example: Persistence Unit Skeleton, Example: Persistence Unit Skeleton>>
* <<JTA Data Source, JTA Data Source>>

You list your application's persistence units as
`<persistence-unit>` child elements of the enclosing `<persistence>`
element.  Each `<persistence-unit>` element identifies a named
persistence unit that will correspond to an `EntityManager` in your
code, and represents a collection of entities in a relational database.

===== Example: Persistence Unit Skeleton

Here is a partial example of a persistence unit named `prod` with a
helpful description:

.`src/main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml`
[source,xml]
----
<!-- ... -->

<persistence-unit name="prod" transaction-type="JTA"> <!--1-->
    <description>The production database</description>

    <!--2-->

</persistence-unit>

<!-- ... -->
----
<1> Because Helidon MP's JPA integration is for container-managed JPA,
    the link:{jakarta-persistence-spec-url}#a12296[`transaction-type`
    attribute] must in practice always be set to `JTA`.
<2> The order of subsequent child elements is significant and governed
    by the
    link:{jakarta-persistence-spec-url}#persistence-xml-schema[XML
    schema].

NOTE: In most microservices, there will be only one persistence unit.

TIP: A `<persistence-unit>` is represented in Jakarta Persistence as
an instance of the
link:{jakarta-persistence-javadoc-url}/jakarta.persistence/jakarta/persistence/spi/persistenceunitinfo[`PersistenceUnitInfo`]
class.

===== JTA Data Source [[JPA-JTA-Data-Source]]

A persistence unit is always associated with exactly one <<DS, named
data source>>.

Because Helidon MP's Jakarta Persistence integration provides support
for container-managed JPA, and because container-managed JPA requires
Jakarta Transactions (JTA), the kind of named data source a
persistence unit is associated with is always a <<JTA, JTA>> data
source.  The `<jta-data-source>` element, a child of the
`<persistence-unit>` element, is how you link a persistence unit to a
<<DS, named data source>> you previously <<DS-Configuration,
configured>>.

====== Example: Persistence Unit with JTA Data Source

Here is a partial example of a persistence unit named `prod`, with a
helpful description, linked with a JTA data source named `main`:

.`src/main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml`
[source,xml]
----
<!-- ... --->

<persistence-unit name="prod" transaction-type="JTA">
    <description>The production database</description>
    <jta-data-source>main</jta-data-source> <!--1-->

    <!--2-->

</persistence-unit>

<!-- ... -->
----
<1> This links this persistence unit to a <<DS, data source>> named
    `main`, whose <<DS-Configuration, connectivity information>> can
    be found in a MicroProfile-Config-compatible location, as detailed
    in the <<DS-Configuration, data source configuration>> section
    above.
<2> Other persistence unit characteristics go here.

===== Classes

A persistence unit lists the classes that should be managed and that
will take part in Jakarta Persistence workflows.  You must list:

1. link:{jakarta-persistence-spec-url}#a18[Entity classes]

2. link:{jakarta-persistence-spec-url}#a487[Embeddable classes]

3. link:{jakarta-persistence-spec-url}#mapped-superclasses[Mapped
   superclasses]

4. link:{jakarta-persistence-spec-url}#a2999[Converter classes]

You use a
link:{jakarta-persistence-spec-url}#list-of-managed-classes[sequence
of `<class>` elements] to do this.  Each `<class>` element contains
the fully-qualified class name of one of the types of managed classes
listed above.

NOTE: There are link:{jakarta-persistence-spec-url}#a12305[other
mechanisms that can be used in a `META-INF/persistence.xml` file to
describe managed classes], but they may or may not be honored by a
given JPA provider.

====== Example: Persistence Unit with Class Elements

Here is a partial example of a persistence unit named `prod`, with a
helpful description, linked with a JTA data source named `main`,
containing two entity classes:

.`src/main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml`
[source,xml]
----
<!-- ... --->

<persistence-unit name="prod" transaction-type="JTA">
    <description>The production database</description>
    <jta-data-source>main</jta-data-source>
    <class>com.example.ExampleEntity0</class> <!--1-->
    <class>com.example.ExampleEntity1</class>

    <!--2-->

</persistence-unit>

<!-- ... -->
----
<1> Each entity class is listed with a separate `<class>` element, and
    there is no containing `<classes>` element or similar.
<2> Other persistence unit characteristics go here.

===== Properties

Persistence units can have simple properties attached to them to
further configure the backing JPA provider.  You use the
link:{jakarta-persistence-spec-url}#a12384[`<properties>`
element] to specify them.

NOTE: Helidon MP's Jakarta Persistence integration is for
container-managed JPA, so the vendor-independent properties
link:{jakarta-persistence-spec-url}#a12384[described
in the specification] directly concerned with database connectivity
information, such as `jakarta.persistence.jdbc.url`, **do not apply**
and will be ignored if present.  See <<JPA-JTA-Data-Source, the JTA
Data Source>> section above for how a persistence unit is linked to a
<<DS,named data source>>.

====== Example: Persistence Unit with Properties

Here is a partial exmaple of a persistence unit named `prod`, with a
helpful description, linked with a JTA data source named `main`,
containing two entity classes, configuring a Hibernate ORM-specific
property:

.`src/main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml`
[source,xml]
----
<!-- ... --->

<persistence-unit name="prod" transaction-type="JTA">
    <description>The production database</description>
    <jta-data-source>main</jta-data-source> <!--1-->
    <class>com.example.ExampleEntity0</class>
    <class>com.example.ExampleEntity1</class>
    <properties>
        <property name="hibernate.show_sql" value="true"/> <!--2-->
        <property name="eclipselink.weaving" value="false"/> <!--3-->
    </properties>
</persistence-unit>

<!-- ... -->
----
<1> The name identifies a name present in the
    <<DS-Configuration-Prefixes, _datasourcename_ portion of a named
    datasource configuration>>.  There is no need for any kind of
    reserved prefix (like `java:comp/env`).
<2> This is a Hibernate ORM-specific property and will be properly
    ignored if the JPA provider you have <<JPA-Setup,set up>> is
    Eclipselink.  See
    link:{hibernate-doc-jboss-url}/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#configurations-logging[Statement
    logging and statistics] in the Hibernate ORM documentation for
    more details about the `hibernate.show_sql` property.
<3> This is an Eclipselink-specific property (and (a) is required and
    (b) must be set to `false` if you are using Eclipselink), and will
    be properly ignored if the JPA provider you have <<JPA-Setup, set
    up>> is Hibernate ORM.  See
    link:{eclipselink-doc-base-url}/jpa/extensions/persistenceproperties_ref.htm#weaving[weaving]
    in the Eclipselink documentation for more details about the
    `eclipselink.weaving` property.

TIP: For an exhaustive list of Hibernate ORM-specific properties, see
link:{hibernate-doc-jboss-url}/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#configurations[Configurations]
in the Hibernate ORM documentation.

TIP: For an exhaustive list of Eclipselink-specific properties, see
link:{eclipselink-doc-base-url}/jpa/extensions/persistenceproperties_ref.htm#sthref733[Persistence
Property Extensions Reference] in the Eclipselink documentation.

=== Usage [[JPA-Usage]]

To use Helidon MP's Jakarta Persistence integration, once you have
<<JPA-Setup, set up>> and <<JPA-Configuration, configured>> your
project, you use the Jakarta Persistence APIs in almost the same
manner as if your project were deployed to a Jakarta EE server.

Specifically, you:

1. Annotate your managed classes (entities, mapped superclasses, etc.)
   appropriately (using
   link:{jakarta-persistence-javadoc-url}/jakarta.persistence/jakarta/persistence/entity[`@Entity`]
   and similar annotations)

2. Inject
   link:{jakarta-persistence-javadoc-url}/jakarta.persistence/jakarta/persistence/entitymanager[`EntityManager`]
   instances appropriately with the
   link:{jakarta-persistence-javadoc-url}/jakarta.persistence/jakarta/persistence/persistencecontext[`@PersistenceContext`
   annotation]

3. Use an injected
   link:{jakarta-persistence-javadoc-url}/jakarta.persistence/jakarta/persistence/entitymanager[`EntityManager`]
   to work with your managed objects

In addition, you <<JTA-Usage, use Helidon MP's JTA integration>> to
declare transactional boundaries where appropriate.

A full tutorial of Jakarta Persistence is _well_ beyond the scope of
this documentation.  Consult
link:{jakarta-persistence-spec-url}#entities[the
specification] for details on how to map your entity classes to
relational database tables, and how to perform other related tasks.
