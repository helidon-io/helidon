= About Helidon
:description: about Helidon
:keywords: helidon, java, microservices, microprofile

== A collection of Java libraries

Helidon provides an open source, lightweight, fast, reactive, cloud native framework for developing Java microservices. Helidon implements and supports MicroProfile, a baseline platform definition that leverages Java EE and Jakarta EE technologies for microservices and delivers application portability across multiple runtimes. 



NOTE: Helidon is a collection of Java libraries for writing microservices that run on a fast web core powered by Netty. Your microservices can be plain Java applications. You do not need an
 application server.
 
== Cloud-native Java

Helidon libraries interoperate with popular tools from the cloud-native space, so there's no need for any specific tooling or deployment model. Helidon can be used with:

* https://www.docker.com/[Docker]
* https://kubernetes.io/[Kubernetes]
* https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus]
* https://opentracing.io/[OpenTracing]
* https://coreos.com/etcd/[Etcd]

TIP: The <<guides/01_overview.adoc#_getting_started,Helidon Quickstart Examples>>
 contain support for Docker and Kubernetes.


== Understanding the Helidon Frameworks
Helidon supports two programming models for writing microservices: *Helidon SE* and *Helidon MP*. 

SE is designed to be a microframework that supports the reactive programming model while Helidon MP is an Eclipse MicroProfile runtime that allows the Jakarta EE community to run microservices in a portable way. The table below shows to primary differences between Helidon SE and Helidon MP.

|====================
| Helidon SE |  Helidon MP
|Helidon SE gives you full transparency and puts you in control.|Helidon MP is built on top of the Helidon libraries and provides platform definition that is familiar to enterprise Java developers. 
|Microframework model with a very small footprint and limited functionality (~7 MB) | https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/eclipse-microprofile[Eclipse MicroProfile] implementation; slightly larger footprint than SE (~13 MB) 
|Functional style is reactive non-blocking   |Declarative style with dependency injection
|Transparent "no magic" development experience; pure java application development with no annotations and no dependency injections  |Jakarta EE microprofile development experience; all Jakarta components (CDI, JAX-RS, JSON-P/B)

The Helidon 2.0 release contains significant new features, enhancements and fixes. It also contains backward incompatible changes as described below:

* *GraalVM native-image support in Helidon MP* +
Helidon SE already supports GraalVM, but in 2.0 GraalVM native image support will also be available in Helidon MP. +
<<guides/36_graalnative.adoc,GraalVM Native Images>>

* *Helidon command line tool* +
The new CLI will support live reloading. +
<<need link>>

* *New database client for Helidon SE* +
This will include support for the MongoDB reactive driver and brings Health Checks, Metrics, and Tracing support to every Helidon API. +
<<se/dbclient/01_introduction.adoc,DB Client for Helidon SE>>


* *Extending MicroProfile Reactive Messaging and Reactive Operators Support* +
MP Reactive Operators will be included in both frameworks, while MP Reactive Messaging will only be included in Helidon MP. +
<<need link>>

* *Helidon Web Client* +
The new reactive web client can integrate with other Helidon SE APIs. +
<<need link>>


* *Additional Websocket support* +
Based upon the Tyrus implementation, Helidon receives WebSocket API support. +

* *Support for Java 11 APIs* +
Helidon will require Java 11 or newer. +
<<need link to suuported versions>>


* *CORS support for MP and SE* +
Although it is possible for any Helidon application to implement its own support for CORS, there are common tasks (such as processing preflight requests) that can be provided in a Helidon module. +
