= About Helidon
:pagename: Helidon-introduction
:description: about Helidon
:keywords: helidon, java, microservices, microprofile



Helidon is a collection of Java libraries for writing microservices that run on a fast web core powered by Netty. Its available in two frameworks: Helidon SE and Helidon MP.

== A Collection of Java Libraries 

Helidon provides an open source, lightweight, fast, reactive, cloud native framework for developing Java microservices. Helidon implements and supports MicroProfile, a baseline platform definition that leverages Java EE and Jakarta EE technologies for microservices and delivers application portability across multiple runtimes. 


== Using Cloud-native Tools with Helidon

Helidon libraries interoperate with popular tools from the cloud-native space, so there's no need for any specific tooling or deployment model. Helidon can be used with:

* https://www.docker.com/[Docker]
* https://kubernetes.io/[Kubernetes]
* https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus]
* https://opentracing.io/[OpenTracing]
* https://coreos.com/etcd/[Etcd]

TIP: The <<about/03_prerequisites.adoc,Helidon Quickstart Examples>>
 contain support for Docker and Kubernetes.


== Understanding the Helidon Frameworks
Helidon supports two programming models for writing microservices: *Helidon SE* and *Helidon MP*. 

SE is designed to be a microframework that supports the reactive programming model, while Helidon MP is an Eclipse MicroProfile runtime that allows the Jakarta EE community to run microservices in a portable way. 

The table below shows to primary differences between Helidon SE and Helidon MP.

[cols="3,3"] 
|====================
| *Helidon SE* |  *Helidon MP*

|Helidon SE gives you full transparency and puts you in control.|Helidon MP is built on top of the Helidon libraries and provides platform definition that is familiar to enterprise Java developers. 
|Microframework model with a very small footprint and limited functionality (~7 MB) | https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/eclipse-microprofile[Eclipse MicroProfile] implementation; slightly larger footprint than SE (~13 MB) 
|Functional style is reactive non-blocking   |Declarative style with dependency injection
|Transparent "no magic" development experience; pure java application development with no annotations and no dependency injections  |Jakarta EE microprofile development experience; all Jakarta components (CDI, JAX-RS, JSON-P/B)

== What's New in Helidon 2.0
The Helidon 2.0 release contains significant new features, enhancements and fixes.

TIP: For a complete list of fixes and enhancements, see the Helidon 2.0  https://github.com/oracle/helidon/blob/2.0.0/CHANGELOG.md[changelog].

* *GraalVM Native-image Support in Helidon MP* +
Helidon SE already supports GraalVM, but in 2.0 GraalVM native image support will also be available in Helidon MP. <<mp/guides/36_graalnative.adoc,GraalVM Native Images Guide>> +

* *Helidon Command Line Tool* +
One of the new features in Helidon 2.0 is the addition of a command line interface. The Helidon CLI enables developers to get started with Helidon with minimal effort: you can create a new application, build it, run it, and more, by writing some simple commands.


* *DB Client for Helidon SE* +
The new database client for Helidon SE will include support for the MongoDB reactive driver and brings Health Checks, Metrics, and Tracing support to every Helidon API. <<se/dbclient/01_introduction.adoc, Learn more about the DB Client>>.


* *Extending MicroProfile Reactive Messaging and Reactive Operators Support* +
MP Reactive Operators will be included in both frameworks, while MP Reactive Messaging will only be included in Helidon MP. <<mp/reactivemessaging/01_introduction.adoc, Learn more about Reactive Messaging>> and <<mp/reactivestreams/01_overview.adoc, Reactive Streams>>.

* *Helidon Web Client* +
The new reactive web client can integrate with other Helidon SE APIs. 
<<se/webclient/01_introduction.adoc, Learn more about the Helidon Web Client>>.


* *Additional Websocket Support* +
Based upon the Tyrus implementation, Helidon receives WebSocket API support. 
<<se/websocket/01_overview.adoc, Learn more about Websocket Support>>.


* *Support for Java 11 APIs* +
Helidon will require Java 11 or newer. 
<<about/03_prerequisites.adoc,  Learn more about the prerequisites for Helidon 2.0>>.


* *CORS support for MP and SE* +
Although it is possible for any Helidon application to implement its own support for CORS, there are common tasks (such as processing preflight requests) that can be provided in a Helidon module. <<se/cors/01_introduction.adoc, Learn more about CORS support>>.


* *Backward Incompatible Changes* +
View the https://github.com/oracle/helidon/blob/2.0.0-M1/CHANGELOG.md#backward-incompatible-changes[changelog] for information about potential breaking changes, including package name changes.
