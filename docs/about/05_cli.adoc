= Helidon CLI
:description: Helidon CLI
:keywords: helidon cli

== Introduction

The Helidon CLI lets you easily create a Helidon project by picking from a
set of archetypes. It also supports a developer loop that performs continuous
compilation and application restart, so you can easily iterate over source
code changes.

The CLI is distributed as a standalone executable (compiled using GraalVM) for
ease of installation. It is currently available as a download for Linux, Mac and Windows.
Simply download the binary, install it at a location accessible from your PATH
and you’re ready to go.

== Prerequisites

Helidon requires Java 11 (or newer) and Maven.

application.
