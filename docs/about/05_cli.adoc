:description: Helidon CLI
:keywords: helidon cli

== Introduction

The Helidon CLI lets you easily create a Helidon project by picking from a
set of archetypes. It also supports a developer loop that performs continuous
compilation and application restart, so you can easily iterate over source
code changes.

The CLI is distributed as a standalone executable (compiled using GraalVM) for
ease of installation. It is currently available as download for Linux and Mac.
Simply download the binary, install it at a location accessible from your PATH
and youâ€™re ready to go.

== Installation

[source,bash]
.MacOS
----
curl -O https://helidon.io/cli/latest/darwin/helidon
chmod +x ./helidon
sudo mv ./helidon /usr/local/bin/
----

[source,bash]
.Linux
----
curl -O https://helidon.io/cli/latest/linux/helidon
chmod +x ./helidon
sudo mv ./helidon /usr/local/bin/
----

[source,powershell]
.Windows
----
PowerShell -Command Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://helidon.io/cli/latest/windows/helidon.exe" -OutFile "C:\Windows\system32\helidon.exe"
----

== Create a New Project

[source,bash]
----
helidon init
----

Then answer the questions.

== Developer Loop

[source,bash]
----
cd myproject
helidon dev
----

As you make source code changes the project will automatically recompile and restart your
application.
