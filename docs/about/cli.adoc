== Introduction

The Helidon CLI lets you easily create a Helidon project by picking from a
set of archetypes. It also supports a developer loop that performs continuous
compilation and application restart, so you can easily iterate over source
code changes.

The CLI is distributed as a standalone executable (compiled using GraalVM) for
ease of installation. It is currently available as a download for Linux, Mac and Windows.
Simply download the binary, install it at a location accessible from your PATH
and youâ€™re ready to go.

== Prerequisites

Helidon 3 requires Java 17 (or newer) and Maven.

[role="flex, sm7"]
|=======
|https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads[Java{nbsp}SE{nbsp}17] (http://jdk.java.net[Open{nbsp}JDK{nbsp}17]) or newer
|https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Maven 3.6.1+]
|=======

You should make sure `java` and `mvn` are in your path.

[source,bash]
----
java -version
mvn --version
----

== Installation

[source,bash]
.MacOS
----
curl -L -O https://helidon.io/cli/latest/darwin/helidon
chmod +x ./helidon
sudo mv ./helidon /usr/local/bin/
----

If you get a warning that "the developer cannot be verified" when running the CLI
this is due to the Helidon CLI not being signed and notarized yet. You can disable
this check by running: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine helidon`

[source,bash]
.Linux
----
curl -L -O https://helidon.io/cli/latest/linux/helidon
chmod +x ./helidon
sudo mv ./helidon /usr/local/bin/
----

[source,powershell]
.Windows
----
PowerShell -Command Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://helidon.io/cli/latest/windows/helidon.exe" -OutFile "C:\Windows\system32\helidon.exe"
----

For Windows you will also need the Visual C++ Redistributable Runtime. See xref:windows.adoc[Helidon on Windows]
for more information.

== Create a New Project

[source,bash]
----
helidon init
----

Then answer the questions.

== Developer Loop

[source,bash]
----
cd myproject
helidon dev
----

As you make source code changes the project will automatically recompile and restart your
application.
