== What is Helidon?

link:https://helidon.io[Helidon] is a collection of Java libraries for writing microservices that run on a fast web core powered by link:https://netty.io[Netty]. It's small, fast, and fun to use.

Helidon is open source under the Apache 2.0 license. Sources are available on link:{helidon-github-tree-url}[GitHub].

Helidon is cloud-native ready. It provides fast start-up time and has low memory consumption and a small disk footprint. It also comes with a full observability stack out of the box including health checks, metrics, tracing and logging.

Helidon fully supports GraalVM native image allowing you to build a native executable from your Java application.

== Helidon Flavors

Helidon comes in two flavors: *Helidon SE* and *Helidon MP*. Think about these flavors as frameworks providing similar functionality but offering different developer experiences.

[cols="3,3"]
|====================
| *Helidon SE* |  *Helidon MP*

|Gives you full transparency and puts you in control.
|Built on top of the Helidon SE libraries and provides a platform  that is familiar to enterprise Java developers.

|Microframework model with a very small footprint and limited functionality (~7 MB).
| https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/eclipse-microprofile[MicroProfile] implementation; slightly larger footprint than SE (~13 MB).

|Functional style, reactive, non-blocking.
|Declarative style with dependency injection.

|Transparent "no magic" development experience; pure java application development with no annotations and no dependency injections.
|Developer experience similar to that of Spring Boot, Jakarta EE and MicroProfile; layers on some Jakarta EE components (CDI, JAX-RS, JSON-P, JSON-B).

|====================

To help illustrate the differences, below are two samples implementing a simple RESTful service. One uses Helidon SE, the other Helidon MP.

.Helidon SE sample
[source,java]
----
Routing routing = Routing.builder()
    .get("/hello", 
        (req, res) -> res.send("Hello World"))
    .build();

WebServer.create(routing)
    .start();
----

.Helidon MP sample
[source,java]
----
@Path("hello")
public class HelloWorld {
    @GET
    public String hello() {
        return "Hello World";
    }
}
----

=== What flavor shall I use?

Use Helidon SE if

- Performance is your main goal.
- You are familiar with reactive programming.
- Your application is heavily using concurrency.
- You are not planning to use any CDI-based components.
- You want to use a minimum number of third-party dependencies.

Use Helidon MP if

- You want to base your application on modern enterprise Java standards such as Jakarta EE and MicroProfile.
- You are familiar with Java EE, Jakarta EE or Spring Boot and would like to have a  similar development experience.
- You are migrating existing Java EE/Jakarta EE application to microservices.
- You are planning to use CDI components or extensions.
- You are planning to use JPA for data access and Jersey (JAX-RS) for RESTful services.


[NOTE]
====
If you don't know which Helidon flavor to use â€“ use *Helidon MP*.
====

== Prerequisites

// tag::prereqs[]
Helidon requires Java and Maven.
You might also need Docker and Kubernetes depending on how you plan to deploy your services.

// end::prereqs[]
We also strongly suggest installing the xref:cli.adoc[Helidon CLI] (command line interface) which helps in generating and building Helidon projects.

== Migration

In case you need to upgrade the version of Helidon, follow the `Migration Guides`.

For migration from Helidon 1.x to 2.x:

* xref:{rootdir}/se/guides/migration.adoc[Helidon SE 2x Migration Guide]
* xref:{rootdir}/mp/guides/migration.adoc[Helidon MP 2x Migration Guide]

For migration from Helidon 2.x to 3.x:

* xref:{rootdir}/se/guides/migration_3x.adoc[Helidon SE 3x Migration Guide]
* xref:{rootdir}/mp/guides/migration_3x.adoc[Helidon MP 3x Migration Guide]
