== What is Helidon?

link:https://helidon.io[Helidon] is a collection of Java libraries for writing microservices that run on a fast web core powered by link:https://netty.io[Netty]. It's small, fast and fun to use. 

Helidon is open source under Alache 2.0 license. Sources are available on link:{helidon-github-tree-url}[GitHub].

Helidon is cloud-native ready. It provides fast start-up time, has low memory consumption and small disk footprint. It also comes with full observability stack out of the box including Health Checks, Metrics, Tracing and Logging.

Helidon fully supports GraalVM native-image allowing you to build native executable out of your Java application.

== Helidon Flavors

Helidon comes in two flavors: *Helidon SE* and *Helidon MP*. Think about flavors as frameworks providing similar functionality using differet development experience.

[cols="3,3"]
|====================
| *Helidon SE* |  *Helidon MP*

|Helidon SE gives you full transparency and puts you in control.
|Helidon MP is built on top of the Helidon SE libraries and provides platform definition that is familiar to enterprise Java developers.

|Microframework model with a very small footprint and limited functionality (~7 MB) 
| https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/eclipse-microprofile[MicroProfile] implementation; slightly larger footprint than SE (~13 MB)

|Functional style, reactive, non-blocking   
|Declarative style with dependency injection

|Transparent "no magic" development experience; pure java application development with no annotations and no dependency injections  
|Spring Boot, Jakarta EE and MicroProfile development experience; Jakarta EE components (CDI, JAX-RS, JSON-P/B)

|====================

To better understand differences below are two samples implementing a simple RESTful service. One is using Helidon SE, another Helidon MP.

.Helidon SE sample
[source,java]
----
Routing routing = Routing.builder()
    .get("/hello", 
        (req, res) -> res.send("Hello World"))
    .build();

WebServer.create(routing)
    .start();
----

.Helidon MP sample
[source,java]
----
@Path("hello")
public class HelloWorld {
    @GET
    public String hello() {
        return "Hello World";
    }
}
----

=== What flavor shall I use?

Use Helidon SE if

- Performance is your main goal
- You are familiar with Reactive Programming
- Your application is heavily using concurrency
- You are not planning to use any CDI based components
- You want to use minimum number of third-party dependencies

Use Helidon MP if

- You want to base your application on modern enterprise Java standards such as Jakarta EE and MicroProfile
- You are familiar with Java EE, Jakarta EE or Spring Boot and would like to use similar development experience
- You are migrating existing Java EE/Jakarta EE application to microservices
- You are planning to use CDI components or extensions
- You are planning to use JPA for data access and Jersey (JAX-RS) for RESTful services


[NOTE]
====
If you don't know which Helidon flavor to use â€“ use *Helidon MP*
====

== Prerequisites

Helidon 3 requires Java 17 (or newer) and Maven. You need Docker if you want to build and deploy Docker containers. If you want to deploy to Kubernetes, you need `kubectl` and a Kubernetes cluster (you can xref:kubernetes.adoc[install one on your desktop]).

- https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads[Java{nbsp}SE{nbsp}17] (http://jdk.java.net[Open{nbsp}JDK{nbsp}17]) or newer
- https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Maven 3.8.6+]
- https://docs.docker.com/install/[Docker 18.09+]
- https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/[Kubectl 1.16.5+]

We are also strongly suggesting installing xref:cli.adoc[Helidon CLI] (Command Line Interface) which helps generating and building Helidon projects.

== Next Steps

Next would be to choose a Helidon flavor and start using it. Check the following
