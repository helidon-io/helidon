=== JWT Provider

JSON Web Token (JWT) provider has support for authentication and outbound security.

Authentication is based on validating the token (signature, valid before etc.) and on asserting the subject
of the JWT subject claim.

For outbound, we support either token propagation (e.g. the token from request is propagated further) or
support for generating a brand new token based on configuration of this provider.

==== Configuration Based Approach
All configuration options:

|===
|key |default value |description

|optional | false |If set to true, the provider will return "ABSTAIN" rather than "FAILURE" if token is not present in request
|authenticate |true |Whether to attempt authentication
|propagate |true |Whether to attempt identity propagation/JWT creation
|principal-type |USER |Whether we authenticate a user or a service (other option is SERVICE)
|atn-token | |A group for configuring authentication of the request
|atn-token.verify-signature |true |Whether to verify signature in incoming JWT. If disabled, _ANY_ JWT will be accepted
|atn-token.jwt-audience| |Expected audience of the JWT. If not defined, any audience is accepted (and we may accept JWT not inteded for us)
|atn-token/jwk-* | |Configuration of the JWK to obtain key(s) to validate signatures of inbound token. The JWK should contain public keys. This may be: jwk-path, jwk-resource-path, jwk-url, jwk-content-plain (actual JSON string), jwk-content (base64)
|atn-token/handler |Authorization bearer |A handler configuration for inbound token - e.g. how to extract it
|atn-token/handler/header |Authorization |Name of a header the token is expected in
|atn-token/handler/prefix |bearer  |Prefix before the token value (optional)
|atn-token/handler/regexp | |Regular expression to obtain the token, first matching group is used (optional)
|sign-token | |A group for configuring outbound security
|sign-token/jwk-* | |Configuration of the JWK to use when generating tokens (follows same rules as atn-token/jwk above), this JWK must contain private keys when using asymmetric ciphers
|sign-token/jwt-issuer | |When we issue a new token, this is the issuer to be placed into it (validated by target service)
|sign-token/outbound | |A group for configuring outbound rules (based on transport, host and/or path)
|sign-token/outbound/name | |A short descriptive name for configured target service(s)
|sign-token/outbound/transports |* |An array of transports this outbound matches (e.g. https)
|sign-token/outbound/hosts |* |An array of hosts this outbound matches, may use * as a a wild-card (e.g. *.oracle.com)
|sign-token/outbound/paths |* |An array of paths on the host this outbound matches, may use * as a wild-card (e.g. /some/path/*)
|sign-token/outbound/outbound-token |Authorization bearer  |Configuration of outbound token handler (same as atn-token/handler)
|sign-token/outbound/outbound-token/format | |Java text format for generating the value of outbound token header (e.g. "bearer %1$s")
|sign-token/outbound/jwk-kid | |If this key is defined, we are generating a new token, otherwise we propagate existing. Defines the key id of a key definition in the JWK file to use for signing the outbound token
|sign-token/outbound/jwt-kid | |A key to use in the generated JWT - this is for the other service to locate the verification key in their JWK
|sign-token/outbound/jwt-audience | |Audience this key is generated for (e.g. http://www.example.org/api/myService) - validated by the other service
|sign-token/outbound/jwt-not-before-seconds |5 |Makes this key valid this amount of seconds into the past. Allows a certain time-skew for the generated token to be valid before current time (e.g. when we expect a certain misalignment of clocks)
|sign-token/outbound/jwt-validity-seconds |1 day |Token validity in seconds
|===

Example configuration with authentication and outbound security:

[source,yaml]
----
- jwt:
    atn-token:
        jwk-path: "/config/securiy/verify-jwk.json"
        jwt-audience: "my.service"
    sign-token:
        jwk-path: "/config/security/sign-jwk.json"
        jwt-issuer: "http://www.example.org/myservice"
        outbound:
         - name: "internal-services"
           # create a new token
           hosts:
             - "*.example.org"
           jwk-kid: "internal-key"
           jwt-audience: "http://www.example.org/services"
         - name: "b2b-service-49"
           # create a new token and send it in a custom header
           hosts:
             - "b2b.partner.org"
           paths:
             - "/services/49"
           jwk-kid: "partner-b2b"
           jwt-audience: "http://b2b.partner.org"
           outbound-token:
             header: "X-Partner-Auth"
         - name: "as-is"
           # identity propagation (use existing token)
           hosts:
             - "*.internal.org"
----

=== HTTP Basic Authentication Provider

Basic authentication support authentication of request and identity propagation for
outbound calls.
Outbound security with basic authentication only works if the request is authenticated
with basic authentication (e.g. we re-use the username and password from inbound request).

Basic authentication is an HTTP header named `Authorization`
with value of `basic base64(username:password)`.

This provider also supports "challenging" the client to provide basic
authentication if missing from request.

See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7617[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7617].

These authentication schemes
should be _obsolete_, though they provide a very easy way to test a protected resource.
Note that basic authentication sends username and password unencrypted over the network!

==== Configuration Based Approach
All configuration options:

|===
|key |default value |description

|realm | helidon |Authentication realm - may be shown to user by browser
|principal-type |USER |Type of subject authenticated by this provider - USER or SERVICE
|users | none |A list of users (login, password and roles). Currently to externalize this you must use builder approach.
|===

Example configuration with a single user (may have more):

[source,yaml]
----
- http-basic-auth:
    users:
      - login: "jack"
        password: "jackIsGreat"
        roles: ["user", "admin"]
----

Example configuration with a single user (may have more) using secured config
filter (to encrypt passwords) - in this example, the password is intentionally in
clear text to show its value (see <<microprofile/06_configuration.adoc,Configuration Secrets>>)

[source,yaml]
----
- http-basic-auth:
    realm: "helidon"
    users:
      - login: "jack"
        password: "${CLEAR=jackIsGreat}"
        roles: ["user", "admin"]
----

==== Builder Based Approach
Example of builder with a user store (UserStore is an interface that must be implemented).
There is an existing implementation "ConfigUserStore" that can read configuration of users
from Helidon config instance (see "users" configuration key above).
The built instance can then be registered with security to be used for request authentication.

[source,java]
----
HttpBasicAuthProvider.builder()
  .realm("helidon")
  .subjectType(SubjectType.SERVICE)
  .userStore(aUserStore)
  .build();
----

=== HTTP Digest Authentication
Digest authentication provider supports only authentication of inbound requests (no outbound).

This provider also supports "challenging" the client to provide digest
authentication if missing from request.

See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7616[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7616].

These authentication schemes
should be _obsolete_, though they provide a very easy way to test a protected resource.
Note that basic authentication sends username and password unencrypted over the network!

|key |default value |description

|realm |helidon |Authentication realm - may be shown to user by browser
|principal-type |USER |Type of subject authenticated by this provider - USER or SERVICE
|users |none |A list of users (login, password and roles). Currently to externalize this you must use builder approach.
|algorithm |MD5 |Only MD5 supported
|nonce-timeout-millis |1 day |Number of milliseconds for the nonce timeout
|server-secret |random |A string to use as a server secret - this is to use digest auth between multiple servers (e.g. when in a cluster). Used to encrypt nonce. This must not be known outside of this app, as others may create digest requests we would trust.
|qop |NONE |only AUTH supported. If left empty, uses the legacy approach (older RFC version). AUTH-INT is not supported.
|===

Example configuration with a single user (may have more):

[source,yaml]
----
- http-digest-auth:
    realm: "helidon"
    users:
      - login: "jack"
        password: "${CLEAR=jackIsGreat}"
        roles: ["user", "admin"]
----

==== Builder based approach

There is an existing implementation "ConfigUserStore" that can read configuration of users
from Helidon config instance (see "users" configuration key above).
The built instance can then be registered with security to be used for request authentication.

[source,java]
----
HttpDigestAuthProvider.builder()
  .realm("helidon")
  .digestServerSecret("aPassword".toCharArray())
  .userStore(buildUserStore())
----

=== Header Authentication Provider

This provider inspects a specified request header and extracts the username/service name from it and
asserts it as current subject's principal.

This can be used when we use perimether authentication (e.g. there is a gateway that takes
care of authentication and propagates the user in a header).

|Property |Value

|Maven groupId |io.helidon.security.providers
|Maven artifactId |helidon-security-providers-header
|Provider package |io.helidon.security.providers.header
|Provider class |HeaderAtnProvider
|Provider key |header-atn
|===

* Authentication Provider
* Outbound Security Provider

----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.security.providers</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-security-providers-header</artifactId>

----

==== Configuration Based Approach
All configuration options:

|===
|key |default value |description

|optional | false |If set to true, provider will abstain rather then fail if header not available
|authenticate| true |If set to false, authentication will not be attempted
|propagate | true |If set to false, identity propagation will not be done
|principal-type | USER |Can be USER or SERVICE
|atn-token | none | Token extraction and propagation, you can define which header to use and how to extract it
|outbound-token | atn-token | If outbound token should be created differently than inbound
|===

Example configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
- header-atn:
    optional: true
    principal-type: SERVICE
    atn-token:
      header: "X-AUTH-USER"
    outbound-token:
      header: "Authorization"
      format: "bearer %1$s"

----

==== Builder Based Approach
Example of a builder that configures the provider the same way as the above configuration approach.

    .optional(true)
    .subjectType(SubjectType.SERVICE)
    .atnTokenHandler(TokenHandler.builder()
                             .tokenHeader("X-AUTH-USER")
                             .build())
    .outboundTokenHandler(TokenHandler.builder()
                                  .tokenHeader("Authorization")
                                  .tokenFormat("bearer %1$s")
                                  .build())
    .build();
----

=== HTTP Signatures

Support for HTTP Signatures (both inbound and outbound).

    <artifactId>helidon-security-providers-http-sign</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

==== Signature basics

* standard: based on https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-cavage-http-signatures-03
* key-id: an arbitrary string used to locate signature configuration - when a
 request is received the provider locates validation configuration based on this
 id (e.g. HMAC shared secret or RSA public key). Commonly used meanings are: key
 fingerprint (RSA); API Key


==== Inbound signatures
We act as a server and another party is calling us with a signed HTTP request.
We validate the signature and assume identity of the caller.

Builder example, starting from inside out:
[source,java]
.Inbound signature configuration
----
// Configuration of public key certificate to validate inbound requests
        KeyConfig keyConfig = KeyConfig.keystoreBuilder()
                .keystore(Resource.create(Paths.get("keystore.p12")))
                .keystorePassphrase("password".toCharArray())
                .certAlias("service_cert")
                .build();

        // Create inbound client definition (e.g. map key-id to a public key and principal name)
        InboundClientDefinition rsaInbound = InboundClientDefinition.builder("service1-rsa")
                .principalName("Service1")
                .publicKeyConfig(keyConfig)
                .build();

        // Now create a HTTP signature provider with inbound support (with a single supported signature)
        HttpSignProvider.builder()
                .addInbound(rsaInbound)
                .build();
----

Configuration examples for hmac-sha256 and rsa-sha256 algorithms (as supported by
 this provider):

[source,conf]
.Inbound signature configuration
----
http-signatures {
    inbound {
        keys: [
            {
                key-id = "service1-hmac"
                # name of principal of the connecting party
                principal-name = "Service1"
                # SERVICE or USER, defaults to SERVICE
                principal-type = SERVICE
                # defaults to the one we configure (e.g. if hmac.secret is configured
                # it is hmac-sha256; if public-key is configured, it is rsa-sha256)
                algorithm = "hmac-sha256"
                # shared secret for symmetric signatures
                hmac.secret = "${CLEAR=encryptMe}"
            },
            {
                key-id = "service1-rsa"
                principal-name = "Service1"
                # configuration of public key to validate signature
                public-key {
                    # path to keystore
                    keystore-path = "src/main/resources/keystore.p12"
                    # defaults to PKCS12
                    keystore-type = "PKCS12"
                    # password of the keystore
                    # the ${CLEAR=} is a feature of
                    keystore-passphrase = "${CLEAR=password}"
                    # alias of the certificate to get public key from
                    cert-alias = "service_cert"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}

----

==== Outbound signatures
We act as a client and we sign our outgoing requests.

Builder example, starting from inside out (rsa only, as hmac is significantly
 simpler):
[source,java]
.Outbound signature configuration
----
// Configuration of private key to sign outbound requests
KeyConfig keyConfig = KeyConfig.keystoreBuilder()
        .keystore(Resource.create(Paths.get("src/main/resources/keystore.p12")))
        .keystorePassphrase("password".toCharArray())
        .keyAlias("myPrivateKey")
        .build();

OutboundTarget rsaTarget =  OutboundTarget.builder("service2-rsa")
        .addHost("service2") // considering service registry
        .addPath("/service2-rsa")
        .customObject(OutboundTargetDefinition.class,
                      OutboundTargetDefinition.builder("service1-rsa")
                              .privateKeyConfig(keyConfig)
                              .build())
        .build();

// Now create a HTTP signature provider with outbound support (with a single supported signature)
HttpSignProvider.builder()
        .outbound(OutboundConfig.builder()
                          .addTarget(rsaTarget)
                          .build())
        .build();

        }
    }
]
}

=== ABAC (Attribute based access control) Authorization Provider

This provider is an authorization provider validating various attributes against
configured validators.

Any attribute of the following objects can be used:

 - environment (such as time of request) - e.g. env.time.year
 - subject (user) - e.g. subject.principal.id
 - subject (service) - e.g. service.principal.id
 - object (must be explicitly invoked by developer in code, as object cannot be automatically added to security context) - e.g. object.owner

This provider checks that all defined ABAC validators are validated.
If there is a definition for a validator (e.g. an annotation) that is not checked,
the request is denied.

[source,xml]
.Maven Dependency
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.security.providers</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-security-providers-abac</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

The following validators are implemented:

* <<Role Validator,Roles>>
* <<Scope Validator,Scopes>>
* <<Expression Language Policy Validator,EL Policy>>
* <<Time Validator,Time>>


[source,java]
.Example of using an object
----
@Authenticated
@Path("/abac")
public class AbacResource {
  @GET
  @Authorized(explicit = true)
  @PolicyStatement("${env.time.year >= 2017 && object.owner == subject.principal.id}")
  public Response process(@Context SecurityContext context) {
      // probably looked up from a database
      SomeResource res = new SomeResource("user");
      AuthorizationResponse atzResponse = context.authorize(res);

      if (atzResponse.isPermitted()) {
          //do the update
          return Response.ok().entity("fine, sir").build();
      } else {
          return Response.status(Response.Status.FORBIDDEN)
                  .entity(atzResponse.getDescription().orElse("Access not granted"))
                  .build();
      }
  }
}
----

==== Role Validator
Checks whether user/service is in either of the required role(s).

Configuration Key: role-validator

Annotations: @RolesAllowed, @Roles

[source,java]
.Example
----
@Roles("user_role")
@Roles(value = "service_role", subjectType = SubjectType.SERVICE)
@Authenticated
@Path("/abac")
public class AbacResource {
}
----

===== Interaction with sub-resource locators
When using sub-resource locators in JAX-RS, the roles allowed are collected from each "level" of
 execution:
 - Application class annotations
 - Resource class annotations + resource method annotations
 - Sub-resource class annotations + sub-resource method annotations
 - Sub-resource class annotations + sub-resource method annotations (for every sub-resource on the path)

The `RolesAllowed` or `Roles` annotation to be used is the last one in the path as defined above.

_Example 1:_
There is a `RolesAllowed("admin")` defined on a sub-resource locator resource class.
In this case the required role is `admin`.
