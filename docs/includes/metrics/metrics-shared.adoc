:description: Helidon metrics
:keywords: helidon, metrics
:writing-code-content: code which explicitly invokes the metrics API to register metrics, retrieve previously-registered metrics, and update metric values.

* a unified way for
ifdef::mp-flavor[MicroProfile]
ifdef::se-flavor[Helidon]
servers to export monitoring data--telemetry--to management agents, and
* a unified Java API which all application programmers can use to register and update metrics to expose telemetry data from their services.
ifdef::mp-flavor[]
* support for metrics-related annotations.

=== Instrumenting Your Service

You add metrics to your service
ifdef::se-flavor[]
by writing {writing-code-content}
endif::[]
ifdef::mp-flavor[]
in these ways:

* Annotate bean methods--typically your REST resource endpoint methods (the Java code that receives incoming REST requests); Helidon automatically registers these metrics and updates them when the annotated methods are invoked via CDI.
* Write {writing-code-content}
* Configure some simple `REST.request` metrics which Helidon automatically registers and updates for all REST resource endpoints.
endif::[]

Later sections of this document describe how to do
ifdef::mp-flavor[each of these.]
ifdef::se-flavor[this.]

=== Categorizing Types of Metrics
Helidon distinguishes among three general _types_, or scopes, of metrics, as described in the link:{microprofile-metrics-spec-url}[MP metrics specification].

.Types (scopes) of metrics
[%autowidth]
|====
| Type/scope | Typical Usage

| base | Mandated by the MP metrics specification, such as OS or Java runtime measurements (available heap, disk space, etc.).
| vendor | Implemented by vendors, including the `REST.request` metrics and other key performance indicator measurements (described in later sections).
| application | Declared via annotations or programmatically registered by your service code.
|====

When you add metrics annotations to your service code, Helidon registers the resulting metrics as type `application`.

=== Metric Registries
A _metric registry_ collects registered metrics of a given type. Helidon supports three registries, one for each of the three metrics types.

When you add code to your service to create a metric programmatically, the code first locates the appropriate registry and then registers the metric with that registry.

=== Retrieving Metrics Reports from your Service
When you add the metrics dependency to your project, Helidon automatically provides a built-in REST endpoint `/metrics` which responds with a report of the registered metrics and their values.

Clients can request a particular output format.

.Formats for `/metrics` output
[%autowidth]
|====
| Format | Requested by

| OpenMetrics (Prometheus) | default (`text/plain`)
| JSON | Header `Accept: application/json`
|====

Clients can also limit the report by appending the metric type to the path:

* `/metrics/base`
* `/metrics/vendor`
* `/metrics/application`

Further, clients can narrow down to a specific metric name by adding the name as a subpath such as `/metrics/application/myCount`.

[source,bash]
.Example Reporting: Prometheus format
----
curl -s -H 'Accept: text/plain' -X GET http://localhost:8080/metrics/
----

[listing]
----
# TYPE base:classloader_total_loaded_class_count counter
# HELP base:classloader_total_loaded_class_count Displays the total number of classes that have been loaded since the Java virtual machine has started execution.
base:classloader_total_loaded_class_count 3157
----


.Example Reporting: JSON format
[source,bash]
----
curl -s -H 'Accept: application/json' -X GET http://localhost:8080/metrics/

{
   "base" : {
      "memory.maxHeap" : 3817865216,
      "memory.committedHeap" : 335544320,
    }
}
----

In addition to your application metrics, the reports contain other
metrics of interest such as system and VM information.

=== The `MetricRegistry` API
To register or look up metrics programmatically, your service code uses one of the three  link:{microprofile-metrics-javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/microprofile/metrics/MetricRegistry.html[`MetricRegistry`] instances (base, vendor, and application) which Helidon furnishes automatically.

ifdef::mp-flavor[]
To get a `MetricRegistry` reference

* `@Inject` the metric registry you want, perhaps also using the link:{microprofile-metrics-javadoc-annotation-url}/RegistryType.html[`@RegistryType`] annotation to select the registry type, or
* Get a Helidon link:{metrics-javadoc-base-url}/RegistryFactory.html[`RegistryFactory`]; either
+
--
** `@Inject` `RegistryFactory` or
** Invoke one of the static `getInstance` methods on `RegistryFactory`
--
+
Then invoke `getRegistry` on the `RegistryFactory` instance.
endif::[]
ifdef::se-flavor[]
To get a `MetricRegistry` reference, first get a Helidon link:{metrics-javadoc-base-url}/RegistryFactory.html[`RegistryFactory`].
Then invoke `getRegistry` on the `RegistryFactory` instance.
endif::[]

The `MetricRegistry` allows your code to register new metrics, look up previously-registered metrics, and remove metrics.
