// tag::config-intro[]
== Configuration

To control how the Helidon metrics subsystem behaves, add a `metrics` section to
ifdef::mp-flavor[your `META-INF/microprofile-config.properties` file.]
ifdef::se-flavor[your configuration file, such as `application.yaml`.]

include::{rootdir}/config/io_helidon_metrics_serviceapi_MetricsSupport.adoc[tag=config,leveloffset=+1]

[#example-configuration]
=== Example Configuration

Metrics configuration is quite extensive and powerful and, therefore, a bit complicated.
The rest of this section illustrates some of the most common scenarios:

* <<config-disable,Disable metrics entirely.>>
* <<config-selective,Selectively enable or disable metrics by metric registry type and, within type, by name.>>
* <<config-kpi,Choose whether to collect extended key performance indicator metrics.>>
ifdef::mp-flavor[]
* <<config-rest-request,Control `REST.request` metrics collection.>>

endif::[]
[#config-disable]
==== Disable Metrics Subsystem

.Disabling metrics entirely
ifdef::mp-flavor[]
[source,properties]
----
metrics.enabled=false
----
endif::[]
ifdef::se-flavor[]
[source,yaml]
----
metrics:
  enabled: false
----
endif::[]
Helidon does not update metrics, and the `/metrics` endpoints respond with `404` plus a message that the metrics subsystem is disabled.

[#config-selective]
==== Disable Selected Metrics

You can be even more selective. Within a registry type you can configure up to two regular expression patterns:

* one matching metric names to _exclude_, and
* one matching metric names to _include_.

Helidon updates and reports a metric only if two conditions hold:

* the metric name _does not_ match the `exclude` regex pattern (if you define one), and
* either
** there is no `include` regex pattern, or
** the metric name matches the `include` pattern.

[NOTE]
====
Make sure any `include` regex pattern you specify matches _all_ the metric names you want to capture.
====
Suppose your application creates and updates a group of metrics with names such as `myapp.xxx.queries`, `myapp.xxx.creates`, `myapp.xxx.updates`, and `myapp.xxx.deletes` where `xxx` can be either `supplier` or `customer`.

The following example gathers all metrics _except_ those from your application regarding suppliers _although_ supplier updates are _included_:

.Disabling and enabling metrics by name
ifdef::mp-flavor[]
[source,properties]
----
metrics.registries.0.type=application
metrics.registries.0.application.filter.exclude=myapp\.supplier\..*
metrics.registries.0.application.filter.include=myapp\.supplier\.updates
----
endif::[]
ifdef::se-flavor[]
[source,yaml]
----
metrics:
  registries:
    - type: application
      filter:
        exclude: "myapp\.supplier\..*"
        include: "myapp\.supplier\.updates"
----
endif::[]

This setting excludes metrics with names starting with `myapp.supplier` _except_ for the metric `myapp.supplier.updates`. The `exclude` and `include` values are regular expressions.

[#config-kpi]
==== Collecting Basic and Extended Key Performance Indicator (KPI) Metrics

Any time you include the Helidon metrics module in your application, Helidon tracks two basic performance indicator metrics:

* a `Counter` of all requests received (`requests.count`), and
* a `Meter` of all requests received (`requests.meter`).

Helidon {h1-prefix} also includes additional, extended KPI metrics which are disabled by default:

* current number of requests in-flight - a `ConcurrentGauge` (`requests.inFlight`) of requests currently being processed
* long-running requests - a `Meter` (`requests.longRunning`) measuring the rate at which Helidon processes requests which take at least a given amount of time to complete; configurable, defaults to 10000 milliseconds (10 seconds)
* load - a `Meter` (`requests.load`) measuring the rate at which requests are worked on (as opposed to received)
* deferred - a `Meter` (`requests.deferred`) measuring the rate at which a request's processing is delayed after Helidon receives the request

You can enable and control these metrics using configuration:

.Controlling extended KPI metrics
ifdef::mp-flavor[]
[source,properties]
----
metrics.key-performance-indicators.extended = true
metrics.key-performance-indicators.long-running.threshold-ms = 2000
----
endif::[]
ifdef::se-flavor[]
[source,yaml]
----
metrics:
  key-performance-indicators:
    extended: true
    long-running:
      threshold-ms: 2000
----
endif::[]

[#config-rest-request]
ifdef::mp-flavor[]
==== Enable `REST.request` Metrics

.Controlling REST request metrics
[source,properties]
----
metrics.rest-request-enabled=true
----
Helidon automatically registers and updates `SimpleTimer` metrics for every REST endpoint in your service.
