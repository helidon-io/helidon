// tag::overview[]
The link:{openapi-spec-url}[OpenAPI specification] defines a standard way to express the interface exposed by a REST service.

The link:{microprofile-open-api-spec-url}[MicroProfile OpenAPI spec] explains how MicroProfile embraces OpenAPI, adding annotations, configuration, and a service provider interface (SPI).

ifdef::mp-flavor[Helidon {flavor-uc} implements the MicroProfile OpenAPI specification.]
ifdef::se-flavor[OpenAPI support in Helidon {flavor-uc} draws its inspiration from MicroProfile OpenAPI but does not implement the spec because Helidon {flavor-uc} does not support annotations.]

The OpenAPI support in Helidon {flavor-uc} performs two main tasks:

* Build an in-memory model of the REST API your service implements.
* Expose the model in text format (typically YAML) via the `/openapi` endpoint.

To construct the model, Helidon gathers information about the service API from whichever of these sources are present in the application:

* a _model reader_
+
The SPI defines an interface you can implement in your application for  programmatically providing part or all of the model;
* a static OpenAPI document file packaged as part of your service;
ifdef::mp-flavor[]
* OpenAPI annotations;
endif::[]
* a _filter_ class
+
The SPI defines an interface you can implement in your application which can mask parts of the model.

==== Furnish OpenAPI information about your endpoints
// It's a bit odd to intermix the SE and MP content in this common file this way.
// But I tried having a level 3 section in the SE file include a sequence of
// level 4 sections from here, and that led to errors with headers being out of sequence.
// With the entire level 3 section here and conditional text for SE and MP, AsciiDoctor is happy.
ifdef::se-flavor[]
OpenAPI support in Helidon SE largely follows the link:{microprofile-open-api-spec-url}[MicroProfile OpenAPI spec].
But because Helidon SE does not process annotations, your application supplies data for the OpenAPI model in the other ways listed earlier.
endif::[]

ifdef::mp-flavor[]
Helidon MP OpenAPI combines information from all of the following sources as it
builds its in-memory model of your application's API. It constructs the OpenAPI
document from this internal model. Your application can use one or more of these
techniques.

===== Annotate the endpoints in your app
You can add MicroProfile OpenAPI annotations to the endpoints in your source code.
These annotations allow the Helidon MP OpenAPI runtime to discover the endpoints
and information about them via CDI at app start-up.

Here is one of the endpoints, annotated for OpenAPI, from the example mentioned earlier:

[source,java]
----
@GET
@Operation(summary = "Returns a generic greeting", // <1>
        description = "Greets the user generically")
@APIResponse(description = "Simple JSON containing the greeting", // <2>
        content = @Content(mediaType = "application/json",
                           schema = @Schema(implementation = GreetingMessage.class)))
@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
public JsonObject getDefaultMessage() {...}
----
<1> `@Operation` gives information about this endpoint.
<2> `@APIResponse` describes the HTTP response and declares its media type and contents.

You can also define any request parameters the endpoint expects, although this
endpoint uses none.

This excerpt shows only a few annotations for illustration. The
link:{helidon-github-tree-url}/examples/microprofile/openapi-basic[Helidon MP OpenAPI example] illustrates more,
and the link:{microprofile-open-api-spec-url}[MicroProfile OpenAPI spec] describes them all.

===== Provide a static OpenAPI file
Add a static file at `META-INF/openapi.yml`, `META-INF/openapi.yaml`,
or `META-INF/openapi.json`. Tools such as Swagger let you describe your app's API
and they then generate an OpenAPI document file which you can include in your application
so OpenAPI can use it.

===== Write and configure a model reader class
Write a Java class that implements the OpenAPI
link:{microprofile-open-api-javadoc-url}/OASModelReader.html[`org.eclipse.microprofile.openapi.OASModelReader`] interface. Your
model reader code programmatically adds elements to the internal model that OpenAPI
builds.

link:{microprofile-open-api-javadoc-url}/OASModelReader.html[`org.eclipse.microprofile.openapi.OASModelReader`] interface. Your
model reader code programmatically adds elements to the internal model that OpenAPI
builds.

Change your application's MP configuration to set `mp.openapi.model.reader` as the
fully-qualified class name of your class.

===== Write and configure a filter class
Write a Java class that implements the OpenAPI
link:{microprofile-open-api-javadoc-url}/OASFilter.html[`org.eclipse.microprofile.openapi.OASFilter`] interface.
As OpenAPI composes its internal model, it invokes your filter with each
model element _before_ adding the element to the model. Your filter can
accept the element as-is, modify it, or suppress it.

Change your application's configuration to set `mp.openapi.filter` as the full-qualified
class name of your class.

=== Accessing the REST Endpoint
Once you add the {flavor-uc} OpenAPI dependency to your
ifdef::mp-flavor[project,]
ifdef::se-flavor[project and add code to create the `OpenAPISupport` object to your routing,]
your application automatically responds to the built-in endpoint --
`/openapi` -- and it returns the OpenAPI document describing the endpoints
in your application.

By default, per the MicroProfile OpenAPI spec, the default format of the OpenAPI document is YAML.
There is not yet an adopted IANA YAML media type, but a proposed one specifically
for OpenAPI documents that has some support is `application/vnd.oai.openapi`.
That is what Helidon returns, by default.

In addition, a client can specify the HTTP header `Accept` as either `application/vnd.oai.openapi+json` or
`application/json` to request JSON. Alternatively, the client can pass the query parameter `format` as either `JSON`
or `YAML` to receive `application/json` or `application/vnd.oai.openapi` (YAML) output, respectively.

Remember that, although the JavaDocs describe annotations, Helidon {flavor-uc} does not support them.

=== Building the Jandex index

A Jandex index stores information about the classes and methods in your app and
what annotations they have. It allows CDI to process annotations faster during your
application's start-up.

Add the link:https://github.com/wildfly/jandex-maven-plugin[Jandex maven plug-in] to the `<build><plugins>`
section of your `pom.xml`:

[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.jboss.jandex</groupId>
    <artifactId>jandex-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>{jandex-plugin-version}</version>
    <executions>
      <execution>
        <id>make-index</id>
        <goals>
          <goal>jandex</goal>
        </goals>
      </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
----
When you build your app `maven` should include the index `META-INF/jandex.idx` in
the JAR.

[NOTE]
====
If you _do not_ modify your build to create
the index then the Helidon MP OpenAPI runtime automatically creates one in memory during
app start-up. This slows down your app start-up and, depending on how CDI is
configured, might inadvertently miss information.

We _strongly recommend_ using the Jandex plug-in to build the index into your app.
