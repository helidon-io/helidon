:feature-name: Jaeger Tracing

Helidon is integrated with the Jaeger tracer.

The Jaeger builder is loaded through `ServiceLoader` and configured. You could
also use the Jaeger builder directly, though this would create a source-code dependency
on the Jaeger tracer.

Helidon 3.0 uses the Jaeger OpenTelemetry Tracing client to
integrate with Jaeger tracer.

== Configuring Jaeger

NOTE: Jaeger changed its client implementation, so some Jaeger settings exposed by earlier releases of Helidon are no longer available. Please note the currently-supported settings in the table below.

include::{rootdir}/config/io_helidon_tracing_jaeger_JaegerTracerBuilder.adoc[tag=config,levelOffset=1]

The following is an example of a Jaeger configuration, specified in the YAML format. 

NOTE: The the Jaeger OpenTelemetry client uses port 14250, but you can override this value if needed. The default is defined by each tracing integration.  
[source,yaml]
----
tracing:
    service: "helidon-full-http"
    protocol: "https"
    host: "jaeger"
    port: 14250
