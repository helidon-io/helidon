== Java 17 Runtime

Java 11 is no longer supported in Helidon 3. Java 17 or newer is required.


== javax.* workspace to jakarta.* workspace

Due to trademark restrictions imposed on the javax.* namespace, Jakarta EE will rename all of its specifications to use jakarta.* in order to move forward with evolving the platform with features as the cloud-native Java platform.
In version 3.x Helidon supports MicroProfile 5 specification, which now is fully migrated to `jakarta.x` namespace.

We have moved from dependencies in groupId `javax` (Java EE modules) to dependencies
in groupId `jakarta` (Jakarta EE modules).

In case you declared a dependency on a javax module, you should change it to a jakarta one.

Example:
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>javax.ws.rs</groupId>
    <artifactId>javax.ws.rs-api</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

should be changed to
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>jakarta.ws.rs</groupId>
    <artifactId>jakarta.ws.rs-api</artifactId>
</dependency>
----
As the `javax` module is no longer in dependency management of Helidon parent pom files.

== Project Starter
Project Starter is a new web UI for creating Helidon projects. Itâ€™s highly customizable and provides various options allowing users to select Helidon features they want to add to the project. At the end users will be able to generate projects up to their taste. Check it out <...>


== Updated CLI
In version 3.x Helidon CLI brings all benefits of the Project Starter to the command line allowing users to enjoy customizable project generation without leaving the terminal. See it in action <...>
