== Java 11 Runtime

Java 11 is no longer supported in Helidon 3. Java 17 or newer is required.

== Tracing

We have upgraded to OpenTracing version 0.33.0 that is not backward compatible. OpenTracing
introduced the following breaking changes:

|===
|Removed | Replacement


|`ScopeManager.active()`|`Tracer.activeSpan()`
|`ScopeManager.activate(Span, boolean)`|`ScopeManager.activate(Span)` - second parameter is now always `false`
|`SpanBuilder.startActive()`|`Tracer.activateSpan(Span)`
|`TextMapExtractAdapter` and `TextMapInjectAdapter`|`TextMapAdapter`
| Module name changed `opentracing.api`|`io.opentracing.api` (same for `noop` and `util`)
|===

If you use the `TracerBuilder` abstraction in Helidon and have no custom Spans, there is no
change required

== Security: OIDC

When the OIDC provider is configured to use cookie (default configuration) to carry authentication information,
the cookie `Same-Site` is now set to `Lax` (used to be `Strict`). This is to prevent infinite redirects, as
browsers would refuse to set the cookie on redirected requests (due to this setting).
Only in the case of the frontend host and identity host match, we leave `Strict` as the default
