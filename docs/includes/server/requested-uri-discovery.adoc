Proxies and reverse proxies between an HTTP client and your Helidon application mask important information (for example `Host` header, originating IP address, protocol) about the request the client sent.
Fortunately, many of these intermediary network nodes set or update either the link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Forwarded[standard HTTP `Forwarded` header] or the link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-For[non-standard `X-Forwarded-*` family of headers] to preserve information about the original client request.

Helidon's requested URI discovery feature allows your application--and Helidon itself--to reconstruct information about the original request using the `Forwarded` header and the `X-Forwarded-*` family of headers.

When you prepare the sockets in your server you can include the following optional requested URI discovery settings:

* enabled or disabled
* which type or types of requested URI discovery to use:
** `FORWARDED` - uses the `Forwarded` header
** `X_FORWARDED` - uses the `X-Forwarded-*` headers
** `HOST` - uses the `Host` header
* what intermediate nodes to trust

When your application
ifdef::se-flavor[invokes `request.requestedUri()`]
ifdef::mp-flavor[receives a request]
Helidon iterates through the discovery types you set up for the receiving socket, gathering information from the corresponding header(s) for that type.
If the request does not have the corresponding header(s), or your settings do not trust the intermediate nodes reflected in those headers, then Helidon tries the next discovery type you set up.
Helidon uses the `HOST` discovery type if you do not set up discovery yourself or if, for a particular request, it cannot assemble the request information using any discovery type you did set up for the socket.

// end::intro[]

// tag::obtaining-uriinfo[]
To obtain the requested URI information, your
ifdef::se-flavor[handler or service]
ifdef::mp-flavor[code]
invokes `ServerRequest.requestedUri()` which returns a `UriInfo` record

// end::obtaining-uriinfo[]

// tag::config-example-intro[]
You can
ifdef::se-flavor[also ]
use configuration to set up the requested URI discovery behavior.
ifdef::se-flavor[]
The following example replicates the settings assigned programmatically in the earlier code example:
endif::se-flavor[]
// end::config-example-intro[]
