:feature-name: HTTP Digest Authentication Security Provider

HTTP Digest authentication support

==== Setup

==== Overview

include::{rootdir}/config/io_helidon_security_providers_httpauth_HttpDigestAuthProvider.adoc[leveloffset=+2,tag=config]

==== Example code

[source,yaml]
.Configuration example
----
security:
  providers:
  - http-digest-auth:
      realm: "helidon"
      server-secret: "${CLEAR=service-wide-secret-not-known-outside}"
      users:
      - login: "john"
        password: "${CLEAR=password}"
        roles: ["admin"]
      - login: "jack"
        password: "password"
        roles: ["user", "admin"]
----

==== How does it work?
See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7616[].

*Authentication of request*

When a request is received without the `Authorization: digest ....` header, a challenge is returned to provide such
authentication using `WWW-Authenticate` header.

When a request is received with the `Authorization: digest ....` header, the request is validated
against configured users (and users obtained from custom service if any provided).

Subject is created based on the username and roles provided by the user store.

*Custom user store*

Java service loader service `io.helidon.security.providers.httpauth.spi.UserStoreService` can be implemented to provide
 users to the provider, such as when validated against an internal database or LDAP server.
The user store is defined so you never need the clear text password of the user.

_Note on security of HTTP Digest Authenticaton_

These authentication schemes
should be _obsolete_, though they provide a very easy way to test a protected resource.
