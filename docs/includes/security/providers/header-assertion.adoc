=== Header Authentication Provider
:description: Helidon Security Header Provider
:keywords: helidon, security, header
:feature-name: Header Authentication Security Provider

Asserts user or service identity based on a value of a header.

==== Setup

.Configuration example
----
security:
  providers:
    header-atn:
      atn-token:
        header: "X-AUTH-USER"
      outbound:
        - name: "internal-services"
          hosts: ["*.example.org"]
          # propagates the current user or service id using the same header as authentication
        - name: "partner-service"
          hosts: ["*.partner.org"]
          # propagates an explicit username in a custom header
          username: "service-27"
          outbound-token:
            header: "X-Service-Auth"

==== How does it work?
This provider inspects a specified request header and extracts the username/service name from it and
asserts it as current subject's principal.

This can be used when we use perimeter authentication (e.g. there is a gateway that takes
care of authentication and propagates the user in a header).

*Identity propagation*

Identity is propagated only if an outbound target matches the target service.

The following options exist when propagating identity:
1. We propagate the current username using the configured header
2. We use username associated with an outbound target (see example configuration above)


*Caution*

When using this provider, you must be sure the header cannot be explicitly configured by a user or another service.
All requests should go through a gateway that removes this header from inbound traffic, and only configures it for
authenticated users/services.
Another option is to use this with fully trusted parties (such as services within a single company, on a single
protected network not accessible to any users), and of course for testing and demo purposes.
