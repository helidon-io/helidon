=== How does it work?
At Helidon startup, if OIDC provider is configured, the following will happen:

1. `client-id`, `client-secret`, and `identityUri` are validated - these must provide values
2. Unless all resources are configured as local resources, the provider attempts
to contact the `oidc-metadata.resource` endpoint to retrieve all endpoints

At runtime, depending on configuration...

If a request comes without a token or with insufficient scopes:

1. If `redirect` is set to `true` (default), request is redirected to the authorization
endpoint of the identity server. If set to false, `401` is returned
2. User authenticates against the identity server
3. The identity server redirects back to Helidon service with a code
4. Helidon service contacts the identity server's token endpoint, to exchange the code
for a JWT
5. The JWT is stored in a cookie (if cookie support is enabled, which it is by default)
6. Helidon service redirects to original endpoint (on itself)

Helidon obtains a token from request (from cookie, header, or query parameter):

1. Token is parsed as a singed JWT
2. We validate the JWT signature either against local JWK or against the identity server's
introspection endpoint depending on configuration
3. We validate the issuer and audience of the token if it matches the configured values
4. A subject is created from the JWT, including scopes from the token
5. We validate that we have sufficient scopes to proceed, and return `403` if not
6. Handling is returned to security to process other security providers

== CORS Settings
As an experimental feature, you can set up cross-origin handling for the redirect and logout endpoints in an optional `cors` block inside the `oidc` configuration.
