= The Configuration Component
:h1Prefix: SE
:description: Helidon config introduction
:keywords: helidon, config

The config component provides a Java API to load and process
configuration properties from various sources into a `Config` object which the
application can use to retrieve config data.

== Getting Started

=== Introducing the Config System
A brief overview of the config system helps clarify its different parts
and how they work together. Most applications will typically deal with more
than one of these parts.

image::config/overview.png["Configuration Overview",align="center"]

These are the main parts of the configuration system:

- `Config` system - allows you to read configuration data in an application
- A config source - a location containing configuration data (File, Map, Properties etc.)
- A config parser - a component capable of transforming bytes into configuration data (such as JSON content, YAML etc.)

The `Config` system handles configuration data in an in-memory tree that represents the configuration structure and values.

This approach allows us to take any source data, be it a flat properties file or an object structure such as JSON, and
transform it into a single tree that allows for overriding of values using heterogeneous config sources.

We are using the `.` as a separator of tree structure.

Example of two config sources that can be used by `Config` with the same data tree in different formats:

A Properties source:
[source,properties]
----
web.page-size=25
----

A YAML source:
[source,yaml]
----
web:
  page-size: 25
----

The configuration has the same internal representation in `Config` and can be accessed using
the `Config` API as follows:
[source,java]
----
int pageSize = config.get("web.page-size")
        .asInt()
        .orElse(20);
----

Or using the tree node approach:
[source,java]
----
int pageSize = config
                .get("web")
                .get("page-size")
                .asInt()
                .orElse(20);
----

For this first example we can see the basic features of `Config`:

- Configuration is a tree of `Config` nodes
- You can use `.` as a tree separator when requesting node values
- Each config value can be retrieved as a typed object, with shortcut methods for the most
    commonly used types, such as `int`, `String`, `long` and other
- You can immediately provide a default value for the cases the configuration option is not defined
    in any source

=== Your First Config Application
An easy way to start with the link:{javadoc-base-url-api}/Config.html[Config] API
is to follow these four steps:

1. <<maven-coords,add config-related dependencies to your `pom.xml`>>
2. <<update-module-info, revise your `module-info.java` to refer to config (if you are using Java 9+)>>
3. <<create-simple-config-props, create a simple config properties file>>
4. <<Config-Basics-DefaultConfig, retrieve and use the default `Config` from your app>>

==== Add Maven Dependency on Config [[maven-coords]]
[source,xml]
.Config Dependency in `pom.xml`
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.helidon.config</groupId>
        <artifactId>helidon-config</artifactId>
        <version>version-of-config-you-are-using</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

==== Update `module-info.java` [[update-module-info]]
If you are using Java 11 then create or update the `module-info.java` file for your application:
[source,java]
.Config Dependency in `module-info.java`
----
module myModule {
    requires io.helidon.config;
}
----

==== Create simple Config Properties File [[create-simple-config-props]]
[source]
.Example `src/main/resources/application.properties` config file
----
greeting = Hello

web.debug = true
web.page-size = 20
web.ratio = 1.3

bl.initial-id = 10000000000

origin = props
java.home=homeFromProps # will be ignored
----

==== Write Code using the Default Config [[Config-Basics-DefaultConfig]]

[source,java]
.Create and Use Default `Config` from Java
----
import io.helidon.config.Config; // <1>
...
Config config = Config.create(); // <2>
System.out.println(String.format(
        "greeting is %s\n"
                + "web.debug is %b\n"
                + "web.page-size is %d\n"
                + "web.ratio is %f\n"
                + "bl.initial-id is %d\n"
                + "origin is %s\n"
                + "java.home is %s",
        config.get("greeting").asString().orElse("Default greeting"),  // <3>
        config.get("web.debug").asBoolean().orElse(false),
        config.get("web.page-size").asInt().orElse(50),
        config.get("web.ratio").asDouble().orElse(2.0),
        config.get("bl.initial-id").asLong().orElse(1L),
        config.get("origin").asString().orElse("defaults"),
        config.get("java.home").asString().get())); // <4>
----
<1> Import `Config`.
<2> Create the root of the `Config` tree from the default sources.
<3> Retrieve various values by their dotted names and decode them as the appropriate
Java types, providing default values if the property is missing.
<4> Retrieve the value (and fail with a runtime exception if missing)

When you build and run your project, the output will look like this:
[source]
----
greeting is Hello
web.debug is true
web.page-size is 20
web.ratio is 1.300000
bl.initial-id is 10000000000
origin is props
java.home is /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-10.0.1.jdk/Contents/Home
----


=== Overriding Values

The `Config` system treats config sources as a hierarchy, where the first source that
has a specific configuration key "wins" and its value is used, other sources are not even queried for it.

For example the default configuration when you use `Config.create()` uses the following config sources:

1. System properties config source
2. Environment variables config source
3. A classpath config source called `application.?` where the `?` depends on supported media types
    currently on the classpath. By default it is `properties`, if you have YAML support on classpath,
    it would be `application.yaml`

Let's consider the following keys:

1. System property `answer=42`
2. Environment variable `ANSWER=38`
3. A key in a configuration file `answer=36`

When you request `config.get(`answer`).asInt().orElse(25)`, you would get `42`

This allows you to configure environment specific configuration values through
system properties, environment variables, or through files available on each environment (be it
a physical machine, a Kubernetes pod, or a docker image) without changing your source code.

=== Built-in Support for Config Formats [[built-in-formats]]
If you add additional Helidon config maven artifacts to your dependencies, then the
config system can read formats other than Java properties format and the default
configuration will search for other `application` file types
in the following order. Note that the default configuration _stops_ once it finds
one of the files below; it _does not_ merge all such files it can find.

.Default Config Files (most to least important)
|===
|Source |Helidon maven artifact ID (group ID: `io.helidon.config`) |Notes

|`application.yaml` |`helidon-config-yaml` |YAML format http://yaml.org
|`application.conf` |`helidon-config-hocon` |HOCON format https://github.com/lightbend/config#using-hocon-the-json-superset
|`application.json` |`helidon-config-hocon` |JSON format https://json.org/
|`application.properties` |`helidon-config` |Java properties format
|===


=== Config Filters

Config system applies configured _config filters_ on each value when it is requested
for the first time.

There is a built-in filter called `ValueResolvingFilter` (enabled by default, can be disabled through API)
 that resolves references to other keys in values in configuration.

Example:
Let's consider the following example properties file
[source,properties]
----
host=localhost
first-service.host=${host}/firstservice
second-service.host=${host}/secondservice
----

The filter resolves the `${host}` reference to the `localhost` value.

This makes it easier to override values in testing and production, as you can just
override the `host` key and leave the URIs same.

=== Change Support

Config is an immutable in-memory tree. Nevertheless we know that configuration sometimes changes,
 and we may want to react to such changes.

In `Config` system, you can do this through change support provided by these components:

1. `Config.onChange()` API - you can use to add your listener, to be notified of configuration changes
2. `PollingStrategy` - a component providing regular events to check if a source has changed. This
        requires support in config sources themselves (see `PollableSource`)
3. `ChangeWatcher` - a component watching the underlying source for changes. This requires support
        in config sources themselves (see `WatchableSource`)
4. `EventConfigSource` - an event source that is capable of notifying about changes iteslf


If you want to receive `onChange` events, you must configure your Config with at least one source that is capable of providing changes (having a `PollingStrategy` or `ChangeWatcher` configured, or implementing `EventConfigSource`)

=== Typed config values

The `Config` object lets your application retrieve config data as a typed ConfigValue.

You can retrieve a `ConfigValue<T>` using the following `as` methods in `Config`:
* `asString()` - to get a string config value
* `asBoolean()` and other accessors for primitive types
* `as(Class)` - to get a value for a type that has a mapper configured
* `as(Generic)` - to get a value for a type supporting generics (such as `Set<String>`)
* `asMap()` - to get a map of key to value pairs
* `asList(Class)` - to get a list of typed values
* `as(Function<Config,T>)` - to get a typed value providing a mapper function

ConfigValue<T> can be used to obtain:
* an `Optional<T>` value _from a single node_,
* the `T` value _from a single node_ interpreted as a basic Java type (primitive or simple object) already known to the config system (such as a `boolean` or a `Double`), or
* a complex Java type _from a subtree_ of the config tree.
+
The config system automatically knows how to return `List` and `Map` complex types, and you can provide _config mappers_ to convert a config subtree to whatever
Java types your application needs.

== Next Steps
Although the default configuration is very simple to use, your
application can take as much control as it needs over

* loading configuration data,
* accessing the data once loaded, and
* extending and modifying the behavior of the config system.

You do this by:

* creating and invoking methods on a `Config.Builder` object to construct a `Config` instance
+
Using a builder, the application can control everything about how the config
system creates the resulting `Config` instance: config sources, parsers, polling strategy,
filters, overrides, mappers, whether or not environment variables and Java
system properties serve as config sources. The JavaDoc explains how to use the 
link:{javadoc-base-url-api}/Config.Builder.html[`Config.Builder`].
+
or
* creating a <<config/06_advanced-configuration.adoc#Config-Advanced-metaconfig,meta-configuration>>
file on the runtime classpath or file system to control how the config system prepares the
default configuration.

Once created, the `Config` object provides many methods the application can use to 
retrieve config data as various Java types. See the link:{javadoc-base-url-api}/Config.html[`Config`]
JavaDoc for complete details.
