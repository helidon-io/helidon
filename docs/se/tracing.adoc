== Overview

Distributed tracing is a critical feature of micro-service based applications, since it traces workflow both
within a service and across multiple services. This provides insight to sequence and timing data for specific blocks of work,
which helps you identify performance and operational issues.
Helidon includes support for distributed tracing through its own API, backed by either
through the https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/js/api/tracing/[OpenTelemetry API], or by
https://opentracing.io[OpenTracing API]. Tracing is integrated with WebServer, gRPC Server,
and Security.

== Usage

This section explains a few concepts that you need to understand before you get started with tracing.

* In the context of this document, a _service_ is synonymous with an application.
* A _span_ is the basic unit of work done within a single service, on a single host.
Every span has a name, starting timestamp, and duration.
For example, the work done by a REST endpoint is a span.
A span is associated to a single service, but its descendants can belong to different services and hosts.
* A _trace_ contains a collection of spans from one or more services, running on one or more hosts. For example,
if you trace a service endpoint that calls another service, then the trace would contain spans from both services.
Within a trace, spans are organized as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and
can belong to multiple services, running on multiple hosts.

Support for specific tracers is abstracted. Your application can depend on
the Helidon abstraction layer and provide a specific tracer implementation as a Java
`ServiceLoader` service.
Helidon provides such an implementation for:

- OpenTracing tracers, either using the `GlobalTracer`, provider resolver approach, or explicitly using Zipkin tracer
- OpenTelemetry tracers, either using the global OpenTelemetry instance, or explicitly using Jaeger tracer

=== Setup WebServer

[source,java]
.Configuring OpenTracing `Tracer`
----
ServerConfiguration.builder()
                   .tracer(TracerBuilder.create("my-application")                    // <1>
                                 .collectorUri(URI.create("http://10.0.0.18:9411"))  // <2>
                                 .build())
                   .build()
----
<1> The name of the application (service) to associate with the tracing events
<2> The endpoint for tracing events, specific to the tracer used, usually loaded from Config

=== Setup gRPC Server

[source,java]
.Configuring `Tracer`
----
Tracer tracer = TracerBuilder.create("Server")
        .collectorUri(URI.create("http://10.0.0.18:9411"))   // <1>
        .build();
----
<1> If using zipkin tracing system, the endpoint would be: `http://10.0.0.18:9411/api/v2/spans`

[source,java]
.Configuring Tracing Attributes
----
GrpcTracingConfig tracingConfig = new GrpcTracingConfig.Builder()
                .withStreaming()
                .withVerbosity()
                .withTracedAttributes(ServerRequestAttribute.CALL_ATTRIBUTES,
                     ServerRequestAttribute.HEADERS,
                     ServerRequestAttribute.METHOD_NAME)
                .build();
----

[source,java]
.Configuring gRPC Server
----
GrpcServerConfiguration serverConfig = GrpcServerConfiguration.builder().port(0)
                .tracer(tracer)
                .tracingConfig(tracingConfig)
                .build();
----

=== Creating Custom Spans

To create a custom span that is a child of the WebServer request:

[source,java]
----
Span span = request.tracer()
                .spanBuilder("my-operation")
                .update(spanBuilder -> request.spanContext().ifPresent(spanBuilder::parent))
                .start();
        
        try {
            // Do some work and send a normal response.
            span.end();
        } catch (Throwable t) {
            // Send an error response.
            span.end(t);
        }
----


== Helidon Spans

include::{rootdir}/includes/tracing/common-spans.adoc[]

== Configuration

The following configuration should be supported by all tracer implementations (if feasible)

include::{rootdir}/config/io_helidon_tracing_Tracer.adoc[tag=config,levelOffset=1]

=== Traced Spans Configuration

Each component and its spans can be configured using Config.
The traced configuration has the following layers:

- `TracingConfig` - the overall configuration of traced components of Helidon
- `ComponentTracingConfig` - a component of Helidon that traces spans (such as `web-server`, `security`, `jax-rs`)
- `SpanTracingConfig` - a single traced span within a component (such as `security:atn`)
- `SpanLogTracingConfig` - a single log event on a span (such as `security.user` in span `security:atn`)

The components using tracing configuration use the
`TracingConfigUtil`. This uses the `io.helidon.common.Context` to retrieve
current configuration.


==== Configuration using builder

Builder approach, example that disables a single span log event:

[source,java]
.Configure tracing using a builder
----
TracingConfig.builder()
     .addComponent(ComponentTracingConfig.builder("web-server")
             .addSpan(SpanTracingConfig.builder("HTTP Request")
                     .addSpanLog(SpanLogTracingConfig.builder("content-write").enabled(false).build())
                     .build())
             .build())
     .build()
----

==== Configuration using Helidon Config

Tracing configuration can be defined in a config file.

[source, yaml]
.Tracing configuration
----
tracing:
    components:
      web-server:
        spans:
          - name: "HTTP Request"
            logs:
              - name: "content-write"
                enabled: false
----

[source,java]
.Use the configuration in web server
----
routing.register(WebTracingConfig.create(config.get("tracing")));
----

==== Path-based configuration in Helidon Web Server

For Web Server we have path-based support for configuring tracing, in addition
to the configuration described above.

Configuration of path can use any path string supported by the
Web Server. The configuration itself has the same possibilities
 as traced configuration described above. The path specific configuration
 will be merged with global configuration (path is the "newer" configuration, global is the "older")

[source,yaml]
.Configuration in YAML
----
tracing:
  paths:
    - path: "/favicon.ico"
      enabled: false
    - path: "/metrics"
      enabled: false
    - path: "/health"
      enabled: false
    - path: "/greet"
      components:
        web-server:
          spans:
          - name: "content-read"
            new-name: "read"
            enabled: false
----

[source,java]
.Configuration with Web Server
----
routingBuilder.register(WebTracingConfig.create(config.get("tracing"));
----

[source,java]
.Configuration with Web Server using a builder
----
routingBuilder.register(WebTracingConfig.builder()
    .addPathConfig(PathTracingConfig.builder()
        .path("/metrics")
        .tracingConfig(TracingConfig.DISABLED)
        .build();
    .build());
----

==== Renaming top level span using request properties

To have a nicer overview in search pane of a tracer, you can customize the top-level span name using configuration.

Example:
[source,yaml]
.Configuration in YAML
----
tracing:
  components:
    web-server:
      spans:
      - name: "HTTP Request"
        new-name: "HTTP %1$s %2$s"
----

This is supported ONLY for the span named "HTTP Request" on component "web-server".

Parameters provided:

1. Method - HTTP method
2. Path - path of the request (such as '/greet')
3. Query - query of the request (may be null)

== Additional Information

=== Span Propagation

Span propagation is supported with Helidon WebClient (and with Jersey client, though it is blocking and not suitable for
reactive implementations).
Tracing propagation is automatic as long as the current span context is available in Helidon Context
(which is automatic when running within a WebServer request).

----

[source,java]
.Tracing propagation with Helidon WebClient
----
WebClient client = WebClient.builder()
    .addService(WebClientTracing.create())
    .build();

Single<String> response = client.get()
    .uri(uri)
    .request(String.class);
