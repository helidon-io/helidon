== API

Every Helidon SE application explicitly creates routing rules that govern how Helidon delivers each incoming
request to the code that needs to respond. To add CORS behavior to endpoints, you need to make only minimal
changes to how you set up the routing for those endpoints.
Using the Helidon SE CORS API, you define the CORS behavior that you want and then include that behavior
as you build the routing rules for the services in your application.

The Helidon SE CORS API provides two key classes that you use in your application:

*  `CorsSupport` - Represents information about resource sharing for a single resource.
Typically, you create one `CorsSupport` instance for each distinct resource in your application
(such as the `/greet` resource in the QuickStart greeting application) that should participate in CORS.

* `CrossOriginConfig` - Represents the details for a particular type of sharing, such as which origins are
allowed to have access using which HTTP methods, etc.
Create one instance of `CrossOriginConfig` for each different type of sharing you need.

You associate one or more `CrossOriginConfig` objects with each `CorsSupport` object.
You use the `CorsSupport` object when you construct the routing rules for the service.
When your application is running and requests arrive, the Helidon CORS implementation enforces
the CORS behavior represented by the `CorsSupport` object before routing the request to your
endpoint code for the resource.

Because Helidon SE does not use annotation processing to identify endpoints, you need to
provide the CORS information for your application another way --
by including CORS into the routing you construct for your application.

For each distinct resource or subresource your application exposes:

. Create a link:{webserver-cors-javadoc-base-url}/io/helidon/webserver/cors/CorsSupport.html[`CorsSupport`] instance
corresponding to the resource.
. For each different type of sharing you want to provide for that resource:
.. Create a link:{webserver-cors-javadoc-base-url}/io/helidon/webserver/cors/CrossOriginConfig.html[`CrossOriginConfig`] instance. +
The `CrossOriginConfig` Java class represents the details for a particular type of sharing, such as
which origins are allowed to share via which HTTP methods, etc.
.. Add the `CrossOriginConfig` to the `CorsSupport` instance for this resource.
. Use the resource's `CorsSupport` object in setting up the routing rules for that resource.

Each of these classes has an associated builder that you use in constructing instances of the class.

The table below describes the methods on the `CrossOriginConfig.Builder` class
that map to the headers defined in the CORS protocol.

include::{rootdir}/includes/cors.adoc[tag=cors-config-table]

[[se-api-routing-example]]
=== Sample Routing Setup Using the `CrossOriginConfig` API

The link:{helidon-github-tree-url}/examples/quickstarts/helidon-quickstart-se[Helidon SE Quickstart application]
 lets you change the greeting by sending a `PUT` request to the `/greet/greeting` resource.

This example, based on the QuickStart greeting app, uses the low-level `CrossOriginConfig` API and
the `CorsSupport` API to influence the xref:{rootdir}/se/webserver.adoc#routing[routing],
thereby determining how that resource is shared. (If desired, you can use <<Configuration, configuration>> instead
of the low-level API.)

The following code shows how to prepare your application's routing to support metrics and health support, as well as
CORS.

[[intro-quick-start-code-example]]
[source,java]
----
private static Routing createRouting(Config config) {
    MetricsSupport metrics = MetricsSupport.create();
    GreetService greetService = new GreetService(config);
    HealthSupport health = HealthSupport.builder()
            .addLiveness(HealthChecks.healthChecks())   // Adds a convenient set of checks
            .build();
    CorsSupport corsSupport = CorsSupport.builder()  // <1>
            .addCrossOriginConfig(CrossOriginConfig.builder() // <2>
                        .allowOrigins("http://foo.com", "http://there.com") // <3>
                        .allowMethods("PUT", "DELETE") // <4>
                        .build()) // <5>
            .addCrossOriginConfig(CrossOriginConfig.create()) // <6>
            .build(); // <7>

    // Note: Add the CORS routing *before* registering the GreetService routing.
    return Routing.builder()
            .register(JsonSupport.create())
            .register(health)                   // Health at "/health"
            .register(metrics)                 // Metrics at "/metrics"
            .register("/greet", corsSupport, greetService) // <8>
            .build();
}
----
<1> Create a `CorsSupport.Builder` instance.
<2> Add a `CrossOriginSupport` instance (using _its_ builder) to constrain resource sharing.
<3> List the origins (sites) allowed to share resources from this app.
<4> List the HTTP methods the constraint applies to.
<5> Build the `CrossOriginSupport` instance.
<6> Add a `CrossOriginSupport` instance that permits all sharing (the default).
<7> Build the `CorsSupport` instance.
<8> Register the new `CorsSupport` instance with -- but in front of -- the service which implements the business logic.

The order of steps 2 and 6 above is important. When processing an incoming request, the Helidon CORS implementation
scans the `CrossOriginConfig` instances in the order they were added to the `CorsSupport` object, stopping as soon as
it finds a `CrossOriginConfig` instance for which `allowMethods` matches the HTTP method of the
request.

The few additional lines described above allow the greeting application to participate in CORS.

== Configuration

You can use configuration in combination with the Helidon CORS SE API to add CORS support to your resources by
replacing some Java code with declarative configuration. This also gives your users a way to override the
CORS behavior of your services without requiring the code to change.

include::{rootdir}/includes/cors.adoc[tag=cors-configuration-formats-intro]
include::{rootdir}/includes/cors.adoc[tag=basic-cross-origin-config]

=== Mapped Cross-Origin Configuration
In some cases, you or your users might want to configure CORS behavior based on URL path matching.
// We want to use the following to insert the SE or MP callout 1 text; we need to use the blank, plus,
// and subs because the MP attribute value contains backticks, and this is the only way we've found
// to for the substitution in the callout to work the way we want. And this works when
// rendered in our editing tools and via the asciidoctor command to HTML but not on our built site.
//
// <1> {blank}
// +
// [subs=attributes+]
// {mapped-config-id-callout}
//
// So instead we have the prefix and suffix tags and the including document provides its own callout 1.
// If at some point the rendering for our site handles this, we can just remove the tag and end
// for the prefix and suffix and just have the including file include the mapped-config instead of
// include the prefix, then provide its own callout 1, then include the suffix.
//
include::{rootdir}/includes/cors.adoc[tag=mapped-config-prefix]
<1> Assigns a unique identifier for this mapped CORS config section.
include::{rootdir}/includes/cors.adoc[tag=mapped-config-suffix]

[[using-config-from-app]]
=== Using CORS Configuration in the Application
You use configuration in combination with the Helidon CORS SE API
to add CORS support to your resources. The example in <<se-api-routing-example,Sample Routing Setup Using the `CrossOriginConfig` API>>
uses the low-level Helidon CORS SE API to create
a `CrossOriginConfig` instance that is then used as part of a `CorsSupport` instance to create the routing rules.
As an alternative to using the low-level API, this example uses config to create the
`CrossOriginConfig` instance instead.


[source,java]
----
private static Routing createRouting(Config config) {

    MetricsSupport metrics = MetricsSupport.create();
    GreetService greetService = new GreetService(config);
    HealthSupport health = HealthSupport.builder()
            .addLiveness(HealthChecks.healthChecks())   // Adds a convenient set of checks
            .build();
    CorsSupport.Builder builder = CorsSupport.builder();

    Config config = Config.create(); // Created from the current config sources
    config.get("my-cors") // <1>
            .ifExists(builder::mappedConfig);
    config.get("restrictive-cors") // <2>
            .ifExists(builder::config);
    builder.addCrossOriginConfig(CrossOriginConfig.create()); // <3>

    CorsSupport corsSupport = builder.build(); // <4>

    // Note: Add the CORS routing *before* registering the GreetService routing.
    return Routing.builder()
            .register(JsonSupport.create())
            .register(health)                   // Health at "/health"
            .register(metrics)                 // Metrics at "/metrics"
            .register("/greet", corsSupport, greetService) // <5>
            .build();
}
----
<1> If `my-cors` exists in the configuration, use it to add mapped CORS config to the `CorsSupport` builder.
<2> If `restrictive-cors` exists in the configuration, use it to add basic (not mapped) config to the builder.
<3> Provide default CORS handling for requests that do not match earlier entries.
<4> Obtain the finished `CorsSupport` instance.
<5> Use `corsSupport` in constructing the routing rules.


As each request arrives, Helidon checks it against the cross-origin config instances in the order that your application
added them to the `CorsSupport.Builder`.
The `my-cors` mapped configuration acts as an override because the application added it to the builder first.

If the `my-cors` config key does not appear in the configuration, then the code skips creating a `CrossOriginConfig`
instance based on that configuration, and no overriding occurs. The CORS behavior
that is established by the other `CrossOriginConfig` instance based on the `restrictive-cors` config (if present)
prevails.

NOTE: Remember that if you set configuration in a file that you include as part of your application JAR file, then you need to
rebuild and restart your application for any changes to take effect.

== Examples

For a complete example, see {helidon-github-tree-url}/examples/cors[Helidon SE CORS Example].

== Additional Information

Several built-in Helidon services -- health, metrics, and OpenAPI -- have integrated CORS support.
You can include these services in your application and control their CORS behavior.

include::{rootdir}/includes/cors.adoc[tag=understanding-cors-support-in-services]
include::{rootdir}/includes/cors.adoc[tag=builtin-getting-started]

=== Controlling CORS for Built-in Services Using the API
Although services such as health, metrics, and OpenAPI are built into Helidon, to use them your application must create
instances of the services and then use those instances in building your application's routing rules.

Recall that each
service type has a `Builder` class. To control the CORS behavior of a built-in service using the API, follow these steps:

. Create a `Builder` for the type of service of interest.
. Build an instance of `CrossOriginConfig` with the settings you want.
. Invoke the `builder.crossOriginConfig` method, passing that `CrossOriginConfig` instance.
. Invoke the builder's `build` method to initialize the service instance.
. Use the service instance in preparing the routing rules.

The following excerpt shows changes to the
 link:{helidon-github-tree-url}/examples/quickstarts/helidon-quickstart-se[Helidon SE QuickStart example] which limit
sharing of the `/metrics` endpoint to `\http://foo.com`.

[source,java]
----
private static Routing createRouting(Config config) {
    CrossOriginConfig.Builder metricsCrossOriginConfigBuilder = CrossOriginConfig.builder() // <1>
            .allowOrigins("http://foo.com");
    RestServiceSettings.Builder restServiceSettingsBuilder = RestServiceSettings.builder()
             .crossOriginConfig(metricsCrossOriginConfigBuilder); // <2>
    MetricsSupport metrics = MetricsSupport.builder()
            .restServiceSettings(restServiceSettingsBuilder) // <3>
            .build();
    GreetService greetService = new GreetService(config);
    HealthSupport health = HealthSupport.builder()
            .addLiveness(HealthChecks.healthChecks())   // Adds a convenient set of checks
            .build();

    return Routing.builder()
            .register(health)                   // Health at "/health"
            .register(metrics)                  // Metrics at "/metrics" // <4>
            .register("/greet", greetService)
            .build();
}
----
<1> Create the `CrossOriginConfig.Builder` for metrics, limiting sharing to `\http://foo.com`.
<2> Use the `CrossOriginConfig.Builder` instance in constructing
the `RestServiceSetting.Builder` (which assigns common settings such as the CORS configuration and the web context for the service endpoint).
<3> Use the `RestServiceSetting.Builder` in preparing the `MetricsSupport` service.
<4> Use the `MetricsSupport` object in creating the routing rules.
