== Using Micrometer in Your Application
You need to make two types of changes to your application to use Helidon SE integration with Micrometer:

. Register an instance of link:{javadoc-base-url-api}/MicrometerSupport.html[`MicrometerSupport`] with the web server.
. Create  meters using the meter registry which `MicrometerSupport` manages and update those meters.

=== Register an Instance of `MicrometerSupport` with the Web Server

[source,java]
.Initialize Micrometer support
----
import io.helidon.integrations.micrometer.MicrometerSupport;
//...
MicrometerSupport micrometerSupport = MicrometerSupport.create(); // <1>

Routing.builder()
                .register(micrometerSupport) // <2>
                .register("/myapp", new MyService(micrometerSupport.registry())) // <3>
                .build();
----
<1> Create the `MicrometerSupport` instance, using the default built-in Prometheus meter registry.
<2> Register the support instance as a service; by default, `MicrometerSupport` exposes the endpoint as `/micrometer`.
<3> Pass the `MicrometerSupport` object's meter registry to your service for use in creating and updating meters.

=== Create and Update Meters in your Application Service

[source,java]
.Define and use a `Counter`
----
import io.micrometer.core.instrument.Counter;

public class MyService implements Service {

    private final Counter requestCounter;

    public MyService(MicrometerMeterRegistry registry) {
        requestCounter = registry.counter("allRequests"); // <1>
        // ...
    }

    @Override
    public void update(Routing.Rules rules) {
        rules
            .any(this::countRequests) // <2>
            .get("/", this::myGet);
    }

    private void countRequests(ServerRequest request, ServerResponse response) {
        requestCounter.increment(); // <3>
        request.next();
    }
}
----
<1> Use the Micrometer meter registry to create the request counter.
<2> Add routing for any request to invoke the method which counts requests by updating the counter.
<3> Update the counter and delegate the rest of the request processing to the next handler in the chain.

The example above enrolls the built-in Prometheus meter registry with the default Prometheus registry configuration.
You can change the default setup for built-in registries, and you can enroll other meter registries your application
creates itself.

include::{common-page-prefix-inc}[tag=overriding-intro]

You can override these defaults in either of two ways:

* Using the link:{javadoc-base-url-api}/MicrometerSupport.Builder.html[`MicrometerSupport.Builder`] class
* Using configuration

==== Using `MicrometerSupport.Builder`
Use the `MicrometerSupport.Builder` class to set up Micrometer support however your application needs.

The builder lets you:

* Provide your own Micrometer meter registry configuration that `MicrometerSupport` uses to create a built-in meter
registry, or
* Instantiate a Micrometer meter registry yourself, configured however you want, and add it to the `MicrometerSupport`
object's collection of meter registries

[source,java]
.Overriding defaults for built-in meter registries using `MicrometerSupport.Builder`
----
PrometheusConfig myPrometheusConfig = ...; // <1>
MicrometerSupport support = MicrometerSupport.builder()
                .enrollBuiltInRegistry( // <2>
                        MicrometerSupport.BuiltInRegistryType.PROMETHEUS,
                        myPrometheusConfig)
                .build();
----
<1> Create the meter registry configuration however you need.
<2> Enroll the `PROMETHEUS` built-in registry type with your custom configuration.


==== Using Configuration
include::{common-page-prefix-inc}[tag=overriding-using-config]


=== Enrolling other Micrometer meter registries
To create additional types of registries and enroll them with `MicrometerSupport`, you need to:

. Write a `Handler` +
+
Each meter registry has its own way of producing output.
Write your handler so that it has a reference to the meter registry it should use and so that
its `accept` method sets the payload in the HTTP response using the registry's mechanism for creating output.

. Write a `Function` which accepts a `ServerRequest` and returns an `Optional<Handler>` +
+
In general, your function looks at the request--the `Content-Type`, query parameters, etc.--to
decide whether your handler should respond to the request.
If so, your function should instantiate your `Handler` and return an `Optional.of(theHandlerInstance)`;
otherwise, your function should return `Optional.empty()`. +
+
When `MicrometerSupport` receives a request, it invokes the functions of all the enrolled registries,
stopping as soon as one function provides a handler.
`MicrometerSupport` then delegates to that handler to create and send the response.

. Pass the `Handler` and `Function` to the `MicrometerSupport.enrollRegistry` method to enroll them +
+
[source,java]
.Creating and enrolling your own Micrometer meter registry
----
MeterRegistry myRegistry = new PrometheusMeterRegistry(myPrometheusConfig); // <1>
MicrometerSupport support = MicrometerSupport.builder()
                .enrollRegistry(myRegistry,
                               request -> request // <2>
                                    .headers()
                                    .bestAccepted(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN).isPresent()
                                    ? Optional.of((req, resp) ->
                                            resp.send(myRegistry.scrape())) // <3>
                                    : Optional.empty())
                .build();
----
<1> Create the meter registry. This example uses a Prometheus registry but it can be any extension of `MeterRegistry`.
<2> Provide the function that checks if the link:{javadoc-base-url-webserver}/ServerRequest.html[`ServerRequest`]
accepts content that your meter registry can produce (e.g., either `text/plain` or unspecified is normally an indication for Prometheus-style output)
and returns the appropriate `Optional<link:{:javadoc-base-url-webserver}/Handler.html[``Handler``]>`.
<3> A very simple in-line `Handler` that sets the response entity from the Prometheus registry's `scrape()` method.

include::{common-page-prefix-inc}[tag=accessing-endpoint-intro]

When `MicrometerSupport` receives a request at the endpoint, it looks for the first enrolled meter registry for which
the corresponding `Function<ServerRequest, Optional<Handler>>` returns a non-empty `Handler`.
Helidon invokes that `Handler` which must retrieve the metrics output from its meter registry and set
and send the response.
Note that the `Handler` which your function returns typically has a reference to the meter registry it will use
in preparing the response.
