= Helidon SE 3.x Upgrade Guide
:description: Helidon SE 3.x Upgrade Guide
:keywords: helidon, porting, migration, upgrade, incompatibilities
:rootdir: {docdir}/../..

include::{rootdir}/includes/se.adoc[]

In Helidon 3 we have made some changes to APIs and runtime behavior. This guide
will help you upgrade a Helidon SE 2.x application to 3.x.


== Java 17 Runtime

Java 11 is no longer supported in Helidon 3. Java 17 or newer is required.

== New Routing

Handling routes based on the protocol version is now possible by registering specific routes
on routing builder.

For further information check xref:../webserver.adoc[WebServer Documentation]

== Http/2 Support

Helidon now has the support of HTTP/2 with ALPN over TLS.

For further information check xref:../webserver.adoc[WebServer Documentation]

== WebSocket

Helidon SE support is now based on the `WebSocketRouting` class which enables Helidon application to
configure routing for both annotated and programmatic WebSocket endpoints.
`TyrusSupport` is now deprecated.

Use new dependency to enable `WebSocket`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.webserver</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-webserver-websocket</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

== JEP-290 security hardening

We are taking security seriously. Deserialization is now disabled by default. JEP-290 gives us tools to harden security when deserializing objects (using Java Serialization). In Helidon 3.x, we have decided to forbid any deserialization by default. Helidon does not use Java Serialization at all, and we consider it a high security risk. Java Serialization can still be used if required (requires additional setup to allow specific classes to be deserialized, or by explicitly switching off our JEP-290 support).


== Updated CLI
In version 3.x Helidon CLI brings all benefits of the Project Starter to the command line allowing users to enjoy customizable project generation without leaving the terminal. See it in action xref:{rootdir}/about/cli.adoc[here]!

== Project Starter
Project Starter is a new web UI for creating Helidon projects. Itâ€™s highly customizable and provides various options allowing users to select Helidon features they want to add to the project. At the end users will be able to generate projects up to their taste. Check it out at link:https://helidon.io/starter[Helidon Starter Page]!
