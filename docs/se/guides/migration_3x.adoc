= Helidon SE 3.x Upgrade Guide
:description: Helidon SE 3.x Upgrade Guide
:keywords: helidon, porting, migration, upgrade, incompatibilities
:rootdir: {docdir}/../..

In Helidon 3 we have made some changes to APIs and runtime behavior. This guide
will help you upgrade a Helidon SE 2.x application to 3.x.


== Java 17 Runtime

Java 11 is no longer supported in Helidon 3. Java 17 or newer is required. Please follow the instructions in xref:{rootdir}/includes/prerequisites.adoc}[Prerequisites] for proper installation.

== New Routing

Handling routes based on the protocol version is now possible by registering specific routes
on routing builder.

For further information check xref:../webserver.adoc[WebServer Documentation]

== Http/2 Support

Helidon support of Http/2 is no longer experimental.

Http/2 needed to be explicitly enabled by configuration in Helidon 2:

.Enabling Http/2 support in Helidon 2
[source,yaml]
----
server:
  port: 8080
  host: 0.0.0.0
  experimental:
    enable-http2: true
    http2-max-content-length: 16384
----

In Helidon 3 Http/2 is automatically enabled when artifact with Http/2 support is
available on the classpath.

.Enabling Http/2 support in Helidon 3 by adding dependency
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.webserver</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-webserver-http2</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

With above dependency Helidon 3 supports Http/2 upgrade from Http/1,
cleartext Http/2 without prior knowledge and Http/2 with ALPN over TLS.

In Helidon 2, max content length was configurable with `server.experimental.http2-max-content-length`, in Helidon 3 can be configured with `server.max-upgrade-content-length` globally or per socket with the same `max-upgrade-content-length` key.

.Max upgrade content length in Helidon 3
[source,yaml]
----
server:
  port: 8080
  host: 0.0.0.0
  max-upgrade-content-length: 16384
----

For further information check xref:../webserver.adoc[WebServer Documentation]

== WebSocket

Helidon SE support is now based on the `WebSocketRouting` class which enables Helidon application to
configure routing for both annotated and programmatic WebSocket endpoints.
`TyrusSupport` is now deprecated. Websocket support in now placed in different artifact.

.Helidon 2 WebSocket support dependency
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.webserver</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-webserver-tyrus</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

.Helidon 3 WebSocket support dependency
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.webserver</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-webserver-websocket</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

In Helidon 2, WebSocket routing is defined by registering `TyrusSupport` as additional service:

.Helidon 2 WebSocket route registering
[source, java]
----
WebServer.builder(Routing.builder()
             .register("/rest", new SomeRestService()) //<1>
             .register("/websocket",TyrusSupport.builder() //<2>
                 .register(ServerEndpointConfig.Builder
                           .create(MessageBoardEndpoint.class, "/")
                           .encoders(encoders)
                           .build())
                 .build()
             ))
             .port(8080)
   .build();
----
<1> Traditional REST routing service registration
<2> WebSocket setup with Tyrus service

In Helidon 3, WebSocket routing is defined by adding another routing:

.Helidon 3 WebSocket route registering
[source, java]
----
WebServer.builder()
         .routing(r -> r
              .register("/rest", new SomeRestService()) //<1>
         )
         .addRouting(WebSocketRouting.builder() //<2>
                        .endpoint("/websocket", ServerEndpointConfig.Builder
                                .create(MessageBoardEndpoint.class, "/board")
                                .encoders(encoders)
                                .build())
                        .build())
         .port(8080)
----
<1> Traditional REST routing service registration
<2> WebSocket routing setup

== JEP-290 security hardening

We are taking security seriously. Deserialization is now disabled by default. JEP-290 gives us tools to harden security when deserializing objects (using Java Serialization). In Helidon 3.x, we have decided to forbid any deserialization by default. Helidon does not use Java Serialization at all, and we consider it a high security risk. Java Serialization can still be used if required (requires additional setup to allow specific classes to be deserialized, or by explicitly switching off our JEP-290 support). More information is available xref:{rootdir}/includes/security/jep-290.adoc[here]!

== Updated CLI
In version 3.x Helidon CLI brings all benefits of the Project Starter to the command line allowing users to enjoy customizable project generation without leaving the terminal. See it in action xref:{rootdir}/about/cli.adoc[here]!

== Project Starter
Project Starter is a new web UI for creating Helidon projects. Itâ€™s highly customizable and provides various options allowing users to select Helidon features they want to add to the project. At the end users will be able to generate projects up to their taste. Check it out at link:https://helidon.io/starter[Helidon Starter Page]!

== Deprecations

- The custom Helidon OCI clients have been deprecated (link:https://github.com/oracle/helidon/pull/4015[See PR]). Use the OCI Java SDK instead. If you use Helidon MP you can inject OCI SDK clients by adding the dependency `io.helidon.integrations.oci.sdk:helidon-integrations-oci-sdk-cdi`.

- The MultiPart buffered readers have been deprecated (link:https://github.com/oracle/helidon/pull/4096[See PR]). Use the MultiPart stream readers instead.
