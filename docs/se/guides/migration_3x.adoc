= Helidon SE 3.x Upgrade Guide
:description: Helidon SE 3.x Upgrade Guide
:keywords: helidon, porting, migration, upgrade, incompatibilities
:rootdir: {docdir}/../..

In Helidon 3 we have made some changes to APIs and runtime behavior. This guide
will help you upgrade a Helidon SE 2.x application to 3.x.


== Java 17 Runtime

Java 11 is no longer supported in Helidon 3. Java 17 or newer is required. Please follow the instructions in xref:{rootdir}/about/prerequisites.adoc[Prerequisites] for proper installation.

== New Routing

Handling routes based on the protocol version is now possible by registering specific routes
on routing builder.

For further information check xref:../webserver.adoc[WebServer Documentation]

== Http/2 Support

Helidon support of Http/2 is no longer experimental.

Http/2 needed to be explicitly enabled by configuration in Helidon 2:

.Enabling Http/2 support in Helidon 2
[source,yaml]
----
server:
  port: 8080
  host: 0.0.0.0
  experimental:
    enable-http2: true
    http2-max-content-length: 16384
----

In Helidon 3 Http/2 is automatically enabled when artifact with Http/2 support is
available on the classpath.

.Enabling Http/2 support in Helidon 3 by adding dependency
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.reactive.webserver</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-reactive-webserver-http2</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

With above dependency Helidon 3 supports Http/2 upgrade from Http/1,
cleartext Http/2 without prior knowledge and Http/2 with ALPN over TLS.

In Helidon 2, max content length was configurable with `server.experimental.http2-max-content-length`, in Helidon 3 can be configured with `server.max-upgrade-content-length` globally or per socket with the same `max-upgrade-content-length` key.

.Max upgrade content length in Helidon 3
[source,yaml]
----
server:
  port: 8080
  host: 0.0.0.0
  max-upgrade-content-length: 16384
----

For further information check xref:../webserver.adoc[WebServer Documentation]

== WebSocket

Helidon SE support is now based on the `WebSocketRouting` class which enables Helidon application to
configure routing for both annotated and programmatic WebSocket endpoints.
`TyrusSupport` is now deprecated. Websocket support in now placed in different artifact.

.Helidon 2 WebSocket support dependency
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.reactive.webserver</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-reactive-webserver-tyrus</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

.Helidon 3 WebSocket support dependency
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.reactive.webserver</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-reactive-webserver-websocket</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

In Helidon 2, WebSocket routing is defined by registering `TyrusSupport` as additional service:

.Helidon 2 WebSocket route registering
[source, java]
----
WebServer.builder(Routing.builder()
             .register("/rest", new SomeRestService()) //<1>
             .register("/websocket",TyrusSupport.builder() //<2>
                 .register(ServerEndpointConfig.Builder
                           .create(MessageBoardEndpoint.class, "/")
                           .encoders(encoders)
                           .build())
                 .build()
             ))
             .port(8080)
   .build();
----
<1> Traditional REST routing service registration
<2> WebSocket setup with Tyrus service

In Helidon 3, WebSocket routing is defined by adding another routing:

.Helidon 3 WebSocket route registering
[source, java]
----
WebServer.builder()
         .routing(r -> r
              .register("/rest", new SomeRestService()) //<1>
         )
         .addRouting(WebSocketRouting.builder() //<2>
                        .endpoint("/websocket", ServerEndpointConfig.Builder
                                .create(MessageBoardEndpoint.class, "/board")
                                .encoders(encoders)
                                .build())
                        .build())
         .port(8080)
----
<1> Traditional REST routing service registration
<2> WebSocket routing setup


== Deprecations

- The custom Helidon OCI clients have been deprecated (link:https://github.com/oracle/helidon/pull/4015[See PR]). Use the OCI Java SDK instead. If you use Helidon MP you can inject OCI SDK clients by adding the dependency `io.helidon.integrations.oci.sdk:helidon-integrations-oci-sdk-cdi`.

NOTE: See xref:{rootdir}/se/integrations/oci.adoc#oci-compatibility[Resolving compatibility issue with OCI SDK] for detailed information on how to work around this issue.

- The MultiPart buffered readers have been deprecated (link:https://github.com/oracle/helidon/pull/4096[See PR]). Use the MultiPart stream readers instead.
