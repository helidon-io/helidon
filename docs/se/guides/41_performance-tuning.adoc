== Basic tuning for Helidon SE

1. Configure the size of the Netty worker thread pool
2. Configure Netty's maxOrder setting if using Helidon 2.4.1 or earlier
3. Configure/tune Java heap size as per any Java application


=== 1) Configure Netty worker thread pool size

The Netty worker thread-pool is what handles your incoming requests. It defaults to 2*NCPU. To set it to something else you can set `worker-count` in `resources/application.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
----
server:
  port: 8080
  host: 0.0.0.0
  worker-count: 2
----

=== 2) Configure Netty's maxOrder (Helidon 2.4.1 or earlier)

In some situations Netty can aggressively allocate memory per request. This has been addressed in recent versions of Helidon and Netty, but if you are running an earlier version set this system property when you start your Helidon application:

[source,bash]
----
-Dio.netty.allocator.maxOrder=6
----

You can try smaller numbers.
