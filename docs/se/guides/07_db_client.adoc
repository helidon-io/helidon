== Introduction

The Helidon DB Client offers a simple and easy way to work with databases in reactive application.
In Helidon 2.0.0-M1 we introduced the pre-release version of Helidon DB Client â€” a unified,
reactive API for working with databases in non-blocking way. Helidon team constantly updates this API in order
to make it more user-friendly and efficient. For this matter, it is recommended to use the latest helidon version.

=== Main features

The main features of  Helidon DB Client are:

* *Unified API for data access and query*:
The API was implemented as a layer above JDBC or MongoDB Reactive Streams Java Driver, so any relational databases
with JDBC driver or MongoDB are supported.
* *Reactive database access with non-reactive drivers*:
Most JDBC drivers are blocking. Using them in a reactive application is problematic. Helidon DB Client allows the use
of blocking JDBC drivers in your reactive application by wrapping a blocking driver in an executor service.
* *Observability*:
Support for health checks, metrics and tracing was added to all Helidon SE APIs and the Helidon DB Client
is no exception.
* *Backpressure*:
Helidon DB Client performs database operations only when it is requested by the consumer.
This is propagated all the way to the TCP layer.
* *Portability between relational database drivers*:
The DB Client works with native database statements that can be used inline in the code or defined as named statements
in database configuration. By moving the native query code to configuration files, the Helidon DB Client allows you to
switch to another database by changing the configuration files, not the code.

== Get started with Helidon DB Client

Nothing better than practice to get in touch with all the features described earlier in this guide.
This section helps you through your first application using Helidon DB Client. The objective is to
create a library where customer can bring, get or remove a book.

=== Set up H2 database

A database stores the books from the library. H2 is a java SQL database easy to use and light.
If H2 is not installed on your machine, here are few steps to quickly download and set it up:

    * Download the latest H2 version from the official website: https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html
    ** On windows, let guides yourself by the H2 installer.
    ** On another platform, unzip the downloaded file into your wished directory.
    ** Only the h2-{latest-version}.jar, located into h2/bin folder, will be needed.
    * Run the following command to start H2, do not forget to replace `{latest-version}` by your current version.

[source,bash]
.Open a terminal and enter the following:
----
java -jar h2-{latest-version}.jar -webAllowOthers -tcpAllowOthers
----

This output should be printed:

[source,bash]
.Terminal output
----
Web Console server running at http://127.0.1.1:8082 (others can connect)
Opening in existing browser session.
TCP server running at tcp://127.0.1.1:9092 (others can connect)
PG server running at pg://127.0.1.1:5435 (only local connections)
----

Open the console at http://127.0.1.1:8082 in your favorite browser. It displays a login window.
Select `Generic H2 (Server)` from `Saved Settings`. Here is the list of setting, all of them should be set by default.

* Driver Class: org.h2.Driver
* JDBC URL: jdbc:h2:tcp://localhost/~/test
* User Name: sa
* Password:

Password must stay empty. Press connect, the browser displays a web page. The database is correctly set and running.

=== Create a sample SE project

Generate the project sources using the Helidon SE Maven archetype.
The result is a simple project that can be used for the examples in this guide.

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
.Run the Maven archetype:
----
mvn -U archetype:generate -DinteractiveMode=false \
    -DarchetypeGroupId=io.helidon.archetypes \
    -DarchetypeArtifactId=helidon-quickstart-se \
    -DarchetypeVersion={helidon-version} \
    -DgroupId=io.helidon.examples \
    -DartifactId=helidon-quickstart-se \
    -Dpackage=io.helidon.examples.quickstart.se
----

A new directory named `helidon_quickstart-se` is created.

[source,bash]
.Enter into this directory:
----
cd helidon_quickstart-se
----

=== Add new dependency

First thing to do is to open the pom.xml file and add helidon dependencies to use the DB Client.

[source,xml]
.Copy those dependencies:
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.dbclient</groupId>       <1>
    <artifactId>helidon-dbclient</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.dbclient</groupId>      <2>
    <artifactId>helidon-dbclient-jdbc</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.integrations.db</groupId>   <3>
    <artifactId>h2</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.dbclient</groupId>      <4>
    <artifactId>helidon-dbclient-health</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.dbclient</groupId>      <5>
    <artifactId>helidon-dbclient-metrics</artifactId>
</dependency>
----
<1> DB Client API dependency.
<2> Using JDBC driver for this example.
<3> H2 driver dependency.
<4> Support for health check.
<5> Support for metrics.

=== Configure the DB Client

To configure the application, helidon uses by default the application.yaml. The DB client configuration can be joined
in the same file. It is located here: `src/main/resources`.

[source,yaml]
.Copy those properties into application.yaml
----
db:
  source: jdbc  # <1>
  connection:   # <2>
    url: "jdbc:h2:tcp://localhost:9092/~/test"
    username: "sa"
    password:
  statements:   # <3>
    #Ping statement required for health check
    ping: "SET @HELIDON_PING=0"   # <4>
    create-table: "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS LIBRARY (NAME VARCHAR NOT NULL, INFO VARCHAR NOT NULL)"
    insert-book: "INSERT INTO LIBRARY (NAME, INFO) VALUES (:name, :info)"
    select-book: "SELECT INFO FROM LIBRARY WHERE NAME = ?"
    delete-book: "DELETE FROM LIBRARY WHERE NAME = ?"
----
<1> Source property support two values: jdbc and mongo.
<2> Connection detail we used to set up H2.
<3> SQL statements to manage the database.
<4> The ping statement is mandatory because of health check.

=== Build and set up Helidon DB Client

In the application Main.class, an instance of DbClient is created based on the configuration from
application.yaml.

[source,java]
.Create a DbClient in the Main.startServer method:
----
import io.helidon.dbclient.metrics.DbClientMetrics; // <1>
import io.helidon.dbclient.DbClient;

...

Config config = Config.create(); // Landmark to add DB client

DbClient dbClient = DbClient.builder()
                .config(config.get("db"))       // <2>
                .addService(DbClientMetrics.counter().statementNames("ping"))   // <3>
                .build();
----
<1> Add import statements
<2> Configure the DB Client with the "db" section of application.yaml.
<3> Add a counter for metrics.

The DB Client metric counter will be executed only for ping statement, and check how many times it was invoked.
At this point, the database is empty, and needs to be initialised. To achieve that, the DB Client can be used
to create a table in the database.

[source,java]
.Insert a createTable method below the dbClient:
----
DbClient dbClient = DbClient.builder()
                .config(config.get("db"))
                .addService(DbClientMetrics.counter().statementNames("ping"))
                .build();

createTable(dbClient);
----

[source,java]
.Use the DbClient to build a table:
----
private static void createTable(DbClient dbClient) {
        dbClient.execute(exec -> exec.namedDml("create-table"))     // <1>
                .await();
    }
----
<1> Use the "create-table" script to build a table with book name and information.

The createTable is called only once and create an empty table with two columns: name and info. A new service can
manage request to interact with this table which represent our library.
The services are registered in the createRouting method.

[source,java]
.Modify the createRouting method:
----
import io.helidon.dbclient.health.DbClientHealthCheck;

...

WebServer server = WebServer.builder(createRouting(config, dbClient))   // <1>
                .config(config.get("server"))
                .addMediaSupport(JsonpSupport.create())
                .build();

...

private static Routing createRouting(Config config, DbClient dbClient) {
        MetricsSupport metrics = MetricsSupport.create();
        GreetService greetService = new GreetService(config);
        LibraryService libraryService = new LibraryService(dbClient); // <2>
        HealthSupport health = HealthSupport.builder()
                .addLiveness(HealthChecks.healthChecks())   // Adds a convenient set of checks
                .addLiveness(DbClientHealthCheck.create(dbClient))  // <3>
                .build();

        return Routing.builder()
                .register(health)                   // Health at "/health"
                .register(metrics)                  // Metrics at "/metrics"
                .register("/greet", greetService)
                .register("/library", libraryService)  // <4>
                .build();
    }
----
<1> Add dbClient as a parameter of createRouting method.
<2> Instantiate our LibraryService with the dbClient.
<3> Add Health check to control the application behavior.
<4> Register the LibraryService to the Routing.

The library service does not exist yet but that is the next step of the guide. It has a default constructor with the
DB Client as a parameter because it will manage the library. The DB Client health check uses the ping statement
from the configuration. As shown above, to create a DB Client health check, call the `DbClientHealthCheck.create` method
and pass the concerned DbClient. Then add it to the health support builder and register it to the routing.

=== Create the Library service

Create LibraryService class into `io.helidon.examples.quickstart.se` package.

[source,java]
.LibraryService class looks like this:
----
package io.helidon.examples.quickstart.se;

import io.helidon.common.http.Http;     // <1>
import io.helidon.dbclient.DbClient;
import io.helidon.webserver.Routing;
import io.helidon.webserver.ServerRequest;
import io.helidon.webserver.ServerResponse;
import io.helidon.webserver.Service;

public class LibraryService implements Service {

    private final DbClient dbClient;    // <2>

    LibraryService(DbClient pDbClient){
        this.dbClient = pDbClient;      // <3>
    }
}
----
<1> Add new import statement
<2> Declare the Helidon DB Client
<3> A DB Client instance is provided when LibraryService is instantiated.

As the LibraryService implements `io.helidon.webserver.Service`, the `update(Routing)` method has to be implemented.
It defines application endpoints and Http request which can be reached by clients.

[source,java]
.Add update method to LibraryService
----
@Override
public void update(Routing.Rules rules) {
    rules
        .get("/{name}", this::getBook)      // <1>
        .put("/{name}", this::addBook)      // <2>
        .delete("/{name}", this::deleteBook);   // <3>
}
----
<1> Return information about the required book from the database.
<2> Add a book to the library.
<3> Remove a book from the library.

To summarise, there is one endpoint which can manipulate books. The number of endpoints and application
features can be changed from these rules by creating or modifying methods. `{name}` is a path parameter for the book
name. The architecture of the application is defined, so next step is to create these features.

[source,java]
.Add getBook to the LibraryService:
----
private void getBook(ServerRequest serverRequest, ServerResponse serverResponse) {
        String bookName = serverRequest.path().param("name");   // <1>

        dbClient.execute(exec -> exec.namedGet("select-book", bookName))    // <2>
                .thenAccept(row -> {
                    if (row.isPresent()) {
                        serverResponse.send(row.get().column("INFO").as(String.class)); // <3>
                    } else {
                        serverResponse.status(Http.Status.NOT_FOUND_404)    // <4>
                                .send();
                    }
                })
                .exceptionally(serverResponse::send);   // <5>
}
----
<1> Get the book name from the path in the url.
<2> Helidon db Client execute the `select-book` SQL script from application.yaml.
<3> Send book information to the client.
<4> Send 404 Http status if no book was found for the given name.
<5> If an exception occurred during the process, it is sent to the client.

The `getBook` method reach the book from the database and send the information to the client. The name of the book is
located into the url path. If the book is not present in the database, a Http 404 is sent back.
The `execute(Function<DbExecute, T> executor)` method is called on the dbClient instance to execute one statement.
Nevertheless, it is possible to execute a set of tasks into a single execution unit by using `inTransaction
(Function<DbTransaction, T> executor)` method. DbExecute class provides many builders to create a statement. There are
two builders categories. Builder methods with `Named` keyword uses a statement defined in the configuration file.
Whether builder methods without `Named` keyword uses a statement passed as an argument.

[source,java]
.Add addBook to the LibraryService:
----
private void addBook(ServerRequest serverRequest, ServerResponse serverResponse) {
        String bookName = serverRequest.path().param("name");

        serverRequest.content()
                .as(String.class)
                .thenAccept(newValue -> {
                    dbClient.execute(exec -> exec.createNamedInsert("insert-book")
                            .addParam("name", bookName)     // <1>
                            .addParam("info", newValue)
                            .execute())
                            .thenAccept(count -> serverResponse.status(Http.Status.CREATED_201).send())     // <2>
                            .exceptionally(serverResponse::send);
                });
}
----
<1> The SQL statement requires the book name and its information. They are provided with `addParam` method.
<2> A new book was added to library, so a Http 201 code is returned.

When a user adds a new book, it uses Http PUT method where the book name is in the url and the information in the
request content. To catch this content, the information is retrieved as a string and then the DB Client execute the
`insert-book` script to add the book to the library. It requires two parameters, the book name and information which are
passed to the dbClient thanks to `addParam` method. A Http 201 is sent back as a confirmation if no exception is thrown.

[source,java]
.Add deleteBook to LibraryService:
----
private void deleteBook(ServerRequest serverRequest, ServerResponse serverResponse) {
    String bookName = serverRequest.path().param("name");

    dbClient.execute(exec ->  exec.namedDelete("delete-book", bookName))     // <1>
                        .thenAccept(count -> serverResponse.status(Http.Status.NO_CONTENT_204).send())   // <2>
                        .exceptionally(serverResponse::send);
}
----
<1> Execute SQL script from application.yaml to remove a book from the library by its name.
<2> The required book was removed, so a Http 204 is sent.

To remove a book from the library, use the "delete-book" script in the way than previously. If the book is removed
successfully, a Http 204 is sent back.

== Build and Run the Library application

The application is ready to be built and ran.

[source,bash]
.Run the following to build the application:
----
mvn package
----

Note that the tests are passing as the GreetService process was not modify. During this guide, we only added independent
new content to the existing application.
Make sure H2 is running and start the helidon quickstart by this command:

[source,bash]
.Run the application
----
java -jar target/helidon-quickstart-se.jar
----

Once the application start, check the table LIBRARY is created into H2 database. To do so, go to the
H2 Server console and LIBRARY table should be present in the left column under `jdbc:h2:tcp://localhost:9092/~/test`.
If it is not, try to refresh the page, and it will appear.

Use `curl` to send request to the application:

[source,bash]
.Get a book from the library
----
curl -i http://localhost:8080/library/SomeBook

HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Date: Tue, 12 Jan 2021 14:00:48 +0100
transfer-encoding: chunked
connection: keep-alive
----

There is currently no book inside the library, so the application return a 404. Yet the application created an empty
library table. Try to add a new book.

[source,bash]
.Add a book from the library
----
curl -i -X PUT -d "Fantasy" http://localhost:8080/library/HarryPotter

HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Date: Tue, 12 Jan 2021 14:01:08 +0100
transfer-encoding: chunked
connection: keep-alive
----

This command creates an HTTP PUT request with the gender `Fantasy` content at the address
http://localhost:8080/library/{book-name}. The 201 code means that Harry Potter book was successfully added to
the library. You can now try to get it !

[source,bash]
.Get Harry Potter from the library
----
curl -i http://localhost:8080/library/HarryPotter

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain
Date: Tue, 12 Jan 2021 14:01:14 +0100
connection: keep-alive
content-length: 6

Fantasy
----

The application accepted the request and return an HTTP 200 OK with the book gender which was added earlier.
Harry Potter can be removed from the library with the following:

[source,bash]
.Remove Harry Potter from the library
----
curl -i -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/library/HarryPotter
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Date: Tue, 12 Jan 2021 14:01:22 +0100
connection: keep-alive
----

The book had been removed from the library and confirmed by the 204 Http status. To check that the book was correctly
deleted, try to get it again.

[source,bash]
.Get Harry Potter from the library
----
curl -i http://localhost:8080/library/HarryPotter

HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Date: Tue, 12 Jan 2021 14:00:48 +0100
transfer-encoding: chunked
connection: keep-alive
----

The book is not found. We quickly checked, thanks to this suite of command, the application behavior.

[source,bash]
.Check the health of your application:
----
curl http://localhost:8080/health | json_pp

{
  "state" : "UP"
  "status" : "UP"
  "name" : "jdbc:h2"
}
----

It confirms that the database is UP.

[source,bash]
.Check the metrics of your application:
----
curl -H "Accept: application/json" http://localhost:8080/metrics/application | json_pp

{
  "db.counter.ping" : 1
}
----

The ping statement was invoked once.
To check these records, stop h2 database and make the same curl call.

[source,bash]
.Check the health of your application:
----
curl http://localhost:8080/health | json_pp

{
  "state" : "DOWN"
  "status" : "DOWN"
}
----

Status is down as it failed to connect to the database with a connection timeout.

[source,bash]
.Check the metrics of your application:
----
curl -H "Accept: application/json" http://localhost:8080/metrics/application | json_pp

{
  "db.counter.ping" : 1
}
----

The ping is still one as it did not connect to the database.
To conclude, this guide provides an introduction to Heldion DB Client with a simple example. If you want to learn more
about it, visit the blog post https://medium.com/helidon/helidon-db-client-e12bbdc85b7, it describes in detail the APIs.
You can have a look at helidon DB Client examples which show even more features and complex application.
