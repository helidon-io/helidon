|===

== Getting started with configuration

Helidon provides a very flexible and comprehensive configuration system, offering you many application configuration choices.
You can include configuration data from a variety of sources using different formats, like JSON and YAML.
Furthermore, you can customize the precedence of sources and make them optional or mandatory.
This guide introduces Helidon SE configuration and demonstrates the fundamental concepts using several examples.
Refer to <<config/01_introduction.adoc, Helidon Config>> for the full configuration concepts documentation.

=== Create a sample Helidon SE project

Use the Helidon SE Maven archetype to create a simple project that can be used for the examples in this guide.

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
.Run the Maven archetype:
----
mvn -U archetype:generate -DinteractiveMode=false \
    -DarchetypeGroupId=io.helidon.archetypes \
    -DarchetypeArtifactId=helidon-quickstart-se \
    -DarchetypeVersion={helidon-version} \
    -DgroupId=io.helidon.examples \
    -DartifactId=helidon-quickstart-se \
    -Dpackage=io.helidon.examples.quickstart.se
----

[source,bash]
.The project will be built and run from the `helidon-quickstart-se` directory:
----
cd helidon-quickstart-se
----

=== Configuration Formats

Helidon configuration sources can use different formats for the configuration data. You can specify the
format on a per-source bases, mixing and matching formats as required.  Here are the supported formats,
each with the extension name you should use. By default, Helidon will determine the media type based on the extension name.

* Java Property (.properties)
* JSON (.json)
* YAML (.yaml)
* HOCON (.conf)

The remainder of this document will use these formats in examples and show you how to configure Helidon to parse them.

=== Default configuration

Helidon has an internal configuration, so you are not required to provide any configuration data for your application,
though in practice you most likely would.  By default, that configuration can be overridden from three sources:
system properties, environment variables, and  the contents of `application.yaml` in the classpath.
For example, if you specify a custom server port in `application.yaml` then your server will listen on that port.

In your application code, Helidon uses the default configuration when you create a default `Config` object.
See the following code from the project you created.

[source,Java]
.View `Main.startServer`:
----
    static WebServer startServer() throws IOException {
...
        Config config = Config.create(); // <1>
----
<1> The `Config` object is created with default settings.

=== Source precedence for default configuration

In order to properly configure your application using configuration sources, you need to understand
the precedence rules that Helidon uses to merge your configuration data.  By default,
Helidon will use the following sources in precedence order:

1. Environment variables
2. Java system properties
3. Configuration specified in `application.yaml`

If any of the Helidon required properties are not specified in one of these source, like `server.port`, then Helidon will use a default value.

NOTE: Because environment variable names are restricted to alphanumeric characters and underscore,
Helidon adds aliases to the environment configuration source, allowing entries with dotted and/or
hyphenated keys to be overriden.  For example, this mapping allows an environment variable named "APP_GREETING" to override
an entry key named "app.greeting".  In the same way, an environment variable named "APP_dash_GREETING" will map to
"app-greeting".  See <<config/06_advanced-configuration.adoc,Advanced Config>> for more information.

The following examples will demonstrate the default precedence order.

==== Default configuration resource

Change a configuration parameter in the default configuration resource file, `application.yaml`.
There are no environment variable or system property overrides defined.

[source,bash]
.Change `app.greeting` in `resources/application.yaml` as follows:
----
app:
  greeting: HelloFrom-application.yaml
----

[source,bash]
.Build the application, skipping unit tests, then run it:
----
mvn package -DskipTests=true
java -jar target/helidon-quickstart-se.jar
----

[source,bash]
.Run the curl command in a new terminal window and check the response:
----
curl http://localhost:8080/greet
...
{
  "message": "HelloFrom-application.yaml World!" // <1>
}
----
<1> The new `app.greeting` value in `application.yaml` is used.

===== System property override

A system property has a higher precedence than `application.yaml`.

[source,bash]
.Restart the application with a system property.  The `app.greeting` environment variable is still set:
----
java -Dapp.greeting="HelloFromSystemProperty"  -jar target/helidon-quickstart-se.jar
----

[source,bash]
.Invoke the endpoint below and check the response:
----
curl http://localhost:8080/greet
...
{
  "message": "HelloFromSystemProperty World!" // <1>
}
----
<1> The system property took precedence over `application.yaml`.

===== Environment variable override

An environment variable has a higher precedence than the system property.

[source,bash]
.Set the environment variable and restart the application:
----
export APP_GREETING=HelloFromEnvironment
java -Dapp.greeting="HelloFromSystemProperty"  -jar target/helidon-quickstart-se.jar
----

[source,bash]
.Invoke the endpoint below and check the response:
----
curl http://localhost:8080/greet
...
{
  "message": "HelloFromEnvironment World!" // <1>
}
----
<1> The environment variable `APP_GREETING` took precedence over the system property and the value in `application.yaml`.

== Custom configuration sources

To use custom configuration sources, your application needs to specify the sources when it creates `Config` object. By doing this,
you are in full control of all configuration sources and precedence. By default, the environment variable and system property
sources are enabled, but you can disable them using the `disableEnvironmentVariablesSource` and `disableSystemPropertiesSource`
methods.

This section will show you how to use a custom configuration with various sources, formats, and precedence rules.

=== Full list of configuration sources

Here is the full list of external config sources that you can use programmatically.

1. Environment variables - the property is a name/value pair.
2. Java system properties - the property is a name/value pair.
3. Resources in the classpath - the contents of the resource is parsed according to its inferred format.
4. File - the contents of the file is parsed according to its inferred format.
5. Directory - each non-directory file in the directory becomes a config entry: the file name is the key.
and the contents of that file are used as the corresponding config String value.
6. A URL resource - contents is parsed according to its inferred format.

You can also define custom sources, such as Git, and use them in your Helidon application.
See <<config/06_advanced-configuration.adoc,Advanced Config>> for more information.

=== Classpath sources

The first custom resource example demonstrates how to add a second internal configuration resource that is discovered in the `classpath`.
The code needs to build a `Config` object, which in turn is used to build the `Server` object.  The `Config` object can be built
using a `Config.Builder`, which lets you inject any number of sources into the builder.  Furthermore, you can set precedence for the sources.
The first source has highest precedence, then the next has second highest, and so forth.

[source,text]
.Add a resource file, named `config.properties` to the `resources` directory with the following contents:
----
app.greeting=HelloFrom-config.properties
----

[source,java]
.Update the `Main` class; 1) Add new imports, 2) Replace the `Config.create()` call with `buildConfig()`, and 3) Add `buildConfig` method:
----
import static io.helidon.config.ConfigSources.classpath; // <1>
...

    static WebServer startServer() throws IOException {
...
        Config config =  buildConfig(); // <2>


  private static Config buildConfig() {
    return Config.builder()
        .disableEnvironmentVariablesSource() // <3>
        .sources(
            classpath("config.properties"), // <4>
            classpath("application.yaml")) // <5>
        .build();
  }
----
<1> Add new import statement.
<2> Call the new `buildConfig` method to build a `Config` object.
<3> Disable the environment variables as a source.
<4> Specify the new config.properties resource that is in the `classpath`.
<5> You must specify the existing `application.yaml` or Helidon will not use it as a configuration source
even though it is considered a default source.

[source,bash]
.Build and run the application (without the system property).  Invoke the endpoint and check the response:
----
curl http://localhost:8080/greet
...
{
  "message": "HelloFrom-config.properties World!" # <1>
}
----
<1> The greeting was picked up from `config.properties`, overriding the value in `application.yaml`.

NOTE: It is important to remember that configuration from all sources is merged internally.  If you have the same
configuration property in multiple sources, then only the one with highest precedence will be used at runtime.
This is true even the same property comes from sources with different formats.

Swap the source order and run the test again.

[source,java]
.Update the `Main` class and replace the `buildConfig` method:
----
  private static Config buildConfig() {
      return Config.builder()
          .disableEnvironmentVariablesSource()
          .sources(
              classpath("application.yaml"), // <1>
              classpath("config.properties"))
          .build();
  }
----
<1> Swap the source order, putting `application.yaml` first.

[source,bash]
.Build and run the application, then invoke the endpoint and check the response:
----
curl http://localhost:8080/greet
...
{
  "message": "HelloFrom-application.yaml World!" // <1>
}
----
<1> The file `application.yaml` was used to get the greeting since it now has precedence over `config.properties`.

=== External file sources

You can move all or part of your configuration to external files, making them optional or mandatory.  The obvious advantage to this
approach is that you do not need to rebuild your application to change configuration.  In the following
example, the `app.greeting` configuration property will be added to `config-file.properties`.

[source,bash]
.Unset the environment variable so that `disableEnvironmentVariablesSource` doesn't need to be called:
----
unset APP_GREETING
----

[source,bash]
.Create a file named `config-file.properties` in the `helidon-quickstart-se` directory with the following contents:
----
app.greeting=HelloFrom-config-file.properties
----

[source,java]
.Update the `Main` class; 1) Add new import and 2) Replace the `buildConfig` method:
----
import static io.helidon.config.ConfigSources.file;
...

  private static Config buildConfig() {
      return Config.builder()
          .sources(
              file("config-file.properties"), // <1>
              classpath("application.yaml"))
          .build();
  }
----
<1> Add a mandatory configuration file.

[source,bash]
.Build and run the application, then invoke the endpoint and check the response:
----
curl http://localhost:8080/greet
...
{
  "message": "HelloFrom-config-file.properties World!" # <1>
}
----
<1> The configuration property from the file `config-file.properties` takes precedence.

NOTE: If you want the configuration file to be optional, you must use the `optional` method with `sources`,
otherwise Helidon will generate an error during startup as shown below.  This is true for both `file` and
`classpath` sources.  By default, these sources are mandatory.

[source,java]
.Update the `Main` class and replace the `buildConfig` method:
----
  private static Config buildConfig() {
      return Config.builder()
          .sources(
              file("missing-file"), // <1>
              classpath("application.yaml"))
          .build();
  }
----
<1> Specify a file that doesn't exist.

[source,bash]
.Build then start the application and you will see the following output:
----
Exception in thread "main" io.helidon.config.ConfigException: Cannot load data from mandatory source FileConfig[missing-file]. File `missing-file` not found.
----

To fix this, use the `optional` method as shown below, then rerun the test.

----
...
    file("missing-file").optional(), // <1>

----
<1> The `missing-file` configuration file is now optional.

=== Directory source

A directory source treats every file in the directory as a key, and the file contents as the value.  The
following example includes a directory source as highest precedence.

[source,bash]
.Create a new directory `helidon-quickstart-se/conf` then create a file named `app.greeting` in that directory with the following contents:
----
HelloFromFileInDirectoryConf
----

[source,java]
.Update the `Main` class; 1) Add new import and 2) Replace the `buildConfig` method:
----
import static io.helidon.config.ConfigSources.directory;
...

  private static Config buildConfig() {
      return Config.builder()
          .sources(
              directory("conf"), // <1>
              classpath("config.properties").optional(),
              classpath("application.yaml"))
          .build();
  }
----
<1> Add a mandatory configuration directory.

[source,bash]
.Build and run the application, then invoke the endpoint and check the response:
----
curl http://localhost:8080/greet
...
{
  "message": "HelloFromFileInDirectoryConf World!" # <1>
}
----
<1> The greeting was fetched from the file named `app.greeting`.

==== Exceeding three sources

If you have more than three sources, you need to use a `ConfigSources` class to create a
custom source list as shown below.

[source,java]
.Update the `Main` class; 1) Add new import and 2) Replace the `buildConfig` method:
----
import io.helidon.config.ConfigSources;
...

  private static Config buildConfig() {
      return Config.builder()
          .sources(ConfigSources.create(   // <1>
              directory("conf"),
              file("config-file.properties"),
              classpath("config.properties").optional(),
              classpath("application.yaml")))
          .build();
  }
----
<1> Create a list of four sources using `ConfigSources.create` method.

[source,bash]
.Build and run the application, then invoke the endpoint and check the response:
----
curl http://localhost:8080/greet
...

{
  "message": "HelloFromFileInDirectoryConf World!"
}
----

=== Meta-configuration

Instead of directly specifying the configuration sources in your code, you can use meta-configuration in a file that declares
the configuration sources and their attributes. This requires using the `Config.loadSourcesFrom` method rather than a `Config.Buider`
object. The contents of the meta-configuration file needs to be in JSON, YAML, or HOCON format. YAML is used in the following example.

[source,bash]
.Create a file named `meta-config.yaml` in the `helidon-quickstart-se` directory with the following contents:
----
sources:
  - type: "classpath" // <1>
    properties:
      resource: "application.yaml" // <2>
----
<1> The source type.
<2> The name of the mandatory configuration resource.


[source,java]
.Update the `Main` class and replace the `buildConfig` method:
----
  private static Config buildConfig() {
      return Config.loadSourcesFrom( file("meta-config.yaml")); // <1>
  }
----
<1> Specify the meta-configuration file, which contains a single configuration source.

[source,bash]
.Build and run the application, then invoke the endpoint and check the response:
----
curl http://localhost:8080/greet
...
{
  "message": "HelloFrom-application.yaml World!" // <1>
}
----
<1> The `application.yaml` resource file was used to get the greeting.

The source precedence order in a meta-configuration file is the order of appearance in the file.
This is demonstrated below where the `config-file.properties` has highest precedence.

[source,bash]
.Replace the contents of the `meta-config.yaml` file:
----
sources:
  - type: "file" // <1>
    properties:
      path: "./config-file.properties" // <2>
  - type: "classpath"
    properties:
      resource: "application.yaml"
  - type: "file"
    properties:
      path: "optional-config-file"
      optional: true  // <3>
----
<1> The source type specifies a file.
<2> The name of the mandatory configuration file.
<3> Specify that the `optional-config-file` file is optional.

[source,bash]
.Restart the application, then invoke the endpoint below and check the response:
----
curl http://localhost:8080/greet
...
{
  "message": "HelloFrom-config-file.properties World!" // <1>
}
----
<1> The `config-file.properties` source now takes precedence.

When using a meta-config file, you need to explicitly include both environment variables and system properties as
a source if you want to use them.

[source,bash]
.Replace the contents of the `meta-config.yaml` file:
----
sources:
  - type: "environment-variables" // <1>
  - type: "system-properties" // <2>
  - type: "classpath"
    properties:
      resource: "application.yaml"
  - type: "file"
    properties:
      path: "./config-file.properties"
----
<1> Environment variables are now used as a source.
<2> System properties are now used as a source.


You can re-run the previous tests that exercised environment variables and system properties.  Swap the two types to see
the precedence change.  Be sure to unset APP_GREETING after you finish testing.

== Accessing Config within an application

You have used Helidon to customize configuration behavior from your code using the `Config` and
`Config.Builder` classes.  As discussed previously, Helidon reads configuration from a config source, which uses a config parser
to translate the source into an in-memory tree which represents the configuration’s structure and values.  Helidon offers a variety
of methods to access in-memory configuration.  These can be categorized as _key access_ or _tree navigation_.
You have been using _key access_ for all of the examples to this point.  For example `app.greeting` is accessing
the `greeting` child node of the `app` parent node.  There are many options for access this data using navigation
methods as described in <<config/03_hierarchical-features.adoc,Hierarchical Config>> and <<config/06_advanced-configuration.adoc,Advanced Config>>.


=== Accessing config using keys or navigation

The simplest way to access configuration data is using a key, as shown below in the `GreetService` class.  The
key can be composite as shown below:

[source,java]
.View the `GreetService` constructor:
----
    GreetService(Config config) {
        greeting.set(config.get("app.greeting").asString().orElse("Ciao")); // <1>
    }
----
<1> Get the `app.greeting` node using a composite key.

You can also access the same greeting by navigating the nodes.

[source,java]
.Replace the `GreetService` constructor with the following code:
----
    GreetService(Config config) {
        greeting.set(config.get("app").get("greeting").asString().orElse("Ciao")); // <1>
    }
----
<1> Get the `app` node, then get the child node, `greeting`.

[source,bash]
.Build and run the application, then invoke the endpoint and check the response:
----
curl http://localhost:8080/greet
...
{
  "message": "HelloFrom-application.yaml World!"
}
----

=== Using filters and collections

The Helidon `Config` class provides several methods that allow you to filter and customize the traversal of the
configuration tree.  The example below shows how to get the `greeting` node when you only know it is somewhere in
the `app` subtree.

[source,bash]
.Replace the contents of the `meta-config.yaml` file:
----
sources:
  - type: "classpath"
    properties:
      resource: "application.yaml"
----

[source,bash]
.Replace the app section of the `application.yaml` resource file:
----
app:
  child1: child1-node
  child2:
     child2a:
        greeting: HelloFrom-application.yaml under child2a
  child3: child3-node
----


[source,java]
.Update the `GreetService.java` file; 1) Add new imports and 2) Replace the `GreetService` constructor with the following:
----
// <1>
import java.util.List;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

    GreetService(Config config) {
        List<Config> appGreetings =  config.get("app")
            .traverse()  // <2>
            .filter(node -> node.name().equals("greeting")) // <3>
            .collect(Collectors.toList()); // <4>

        greeting.set(appGreetings.get(0).asString().get());
    }
----
<1> Add new imports.
<2> Traverse the entire subtree of the `app` node.
<3> Include only nodes that have the name `greeting`.
<4> Add the `greeting` node to the collection.

[source,bash]
.Build and run the application, then invoke the endpoint and check the response:
----
curl http://localhost:8080/greet
...
{
  "message": "HelloFrom-application.yaml under child2a World!"
}
----


=== Reacting to configuration updates

Even though in-memory config trees are immutable, the config system internally records configuration source metadata that
allows it to watch sources for changes. Your application listens for updates to the underlying config sources and
reacts to the changes.
See <<config/05_mutability-support.adoc,Config Mutability Support>> for a full discussion on this topic.
The following example demonstrates how to listen and react to configuration changes.

[source,bash]
.Replace the contents of the `meta-config.yaml` file:
----
sources:
  - type: "file"
    properties:
      path: "./config-file.properties"
      polling-strategy:
        type: "watch"
  - type: "classpath"
    properties:
      resource: "application.yaml"
----

[source,java]
.Update the `GreetService` class; 1) Add new import and 2) Replace the `GreetService` constructor:
----
import java.util.function.Consumer;
...

    GreetService(Config config) {
        Config greetingConfig = config.get("app.greeting"); // <1>
        greeting.set(greetingConfig.asString().orElse("Ciao"));
        greetingConfig.onChange((Consumer<Config>) cfg -> greeting.set(cfg.asString().orElse("Ciao"))); // <2>
    }
----
<1> Get the greeting `Config` node.
<2> Register a listener that will get called by Helidon when the configuration changes.  The listener will
update the greeting with the new value.

[source,bash]
.Build and run the application, then invoke the endpoint and check the response:
----
curl http://localhost:8080/greet
...

{
  "message": "HelloFrom-config-file.properties World!"
}
----

[source,bash]
.Update `config-file.properties` with the following contents:
----
app.greeting=Updated HelloFrom-config-file.properties
----


[source,bash]
.After a few seconds, check the response:
----
curl http://localhost:8080/greet
...

{
  "message": "Updated HelloFrom-config-file.properties World!" // <1>
}
----
<1> The application reacted to the change and updated the greeting.


== Integration with Kubernetes

The following example uses a Kubernetes ConfigMap to pass the configuration data to your Helidon application deployed to Kubernetes.
When the pod is created, Kubernetes will automatically create a local file within the container that has the contents of the
configuration file used for the ConfigMap.  This example will create the file at `/etc/config/config-file.properties`.

[source,bash]
.Replace the app section of the `application.yaml` resource file:
----
app:
  greeting: "Hello"
----

[source,java]
.Update the `Main` class and replace the `buildConfig` method:
----
  private static Config buildConfig() {
      return Config.builder()
          .sources(
              file("/etc/config/config-file.properties").optional(), // <1>
              classpath("application.yaml")) // <2>
          .build();
  }
----
<1> The `app.greeting` value will be fetched from `/etc/config/config-file.properties` within the container.
<2> The server port is specified in `application.yaml` within the `helidon-quickstart-se.jar`.

[source,java]
.Replace the `GreetService` constructor with the following code:
----
    GreetService(Config config) {
        greeting.set(config.get("app.greeting").asString().orElse("Ciao"));
    }
----

[source,bash]
.Build and run the application, then invoke the endpoint and check the response:
----
curl http://localhost:8080/greet
...
{
  "message": "Hello World!" // <1>
}
----
<1> The greeting came from `application.yaml` since `/etc/config/config-file.properties` doesn't exist.

[source,bash]
.Stop the application and build the docker image:
----
docker build -t helidon-config-se .
----

[source,bash]
.Generate a ConfigMap from `config-file.properties`:
----
kubectl create configmap helidon-configmap --from-file config-file.properties
----

[source,bash]
.View the contents of the ConfigMap:
----
kubectl get configmap helidon-configmap -o yaml
...
apiVersion: v1
data:
  config-file.properties: |   // <1>
    app.greeting=Updated HelloFrom-config-file.properties   // <2>
kind: ConfigMap
...
----
<1> The file `config-file.properties` will be created within the Kubernetes container.
<2> The `config-file.properties` file will have this single property defined.


[source,yaml]
.Create the Kubernetes YAML specification, named `k8s-config.yaml`, with the following contents:
----
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: helidon-config // <1>
  labels:
    app: helidon-config
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: helidon-config

----
<1> A service of type `NodePort` that serves the default routes on port `8080`.
<2> A deployment with one replica of a pod.
<3> Mount the ConfigMap as a volume at `/etc/config`.  This is where Kubernetes will create `config-file.properties`.
<4> Specify the ConfigMap which contains the configuration data.


[source,bash]
.Create and deploy the application into Kubernetes:
----
kubectl apply -f ./k8s-config.yaml
----

[source,bash]
.Get the service information:
----
kubectl get service/helidon-config
----

[source,bash]
----
NAME             TYPE       CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
helidon-config   NodePort   10.99.159.2   <none>        8080:31143/TCP   8s // <1>
----
<1> A service of type `NodePort` that serves the default routes on port `31143`.

[source,bash]
.Verify the configuration endpoint using port `31143`, your port will likely be different:
----
curl http://localhost:31143/greet
...
{
  "message": "Updated HelloFrom-config-file.properties World!" // <1>
}
----
<1> The greeting value from `/etc/config/config-file.properties` within the container was used.


You can now delete the Kubernetes resources that were just created during this example.

[source,bash]
.Delete the Kubernetes resources:
----
kubectl delete -f ./k8s-config.yaml
kubectl delete configmap  helidon-configmap
----
