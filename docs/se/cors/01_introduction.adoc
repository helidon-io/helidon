link:{cors-spec}[Cross-origin resource sharing] (CORS) support in Helidon SE provides a flexible
mechanism that allows a Helidon SE application to control how other web applications can access its resources, even if that web application is not served from the same domain.



== Getting Started

Before you begin you must:


. Determine the type of cross origin sharing you want to allow for each endpoint in your application.
+
For example, suppose you want to allow unrestricted access for GET, HEAD, and POST requests
(what CORS refers to as "simple" requests), but permit other types of requests only from the two
origins `foo.com` and `there.com`. This means that you have two types of CORS sharing: relaxed for the
simple requests and stricter for others. In practice, you can use as many types of sharing as makes sense for
your application.

. Add the CORS dependencies to the Maven `pom.xml` file.
. Add the CORS support in your application.

The <<about/04_managing-dependencies.adoc, Managing Dependencies>> page describes how you
should declare dependency management for Helidon applications. For CORS support, you must include
the following dependency in your project:

[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.webserver</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-webserver-cors</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

== Adding CORS Support in Your Helidon SE Application [[adding-cors-support]]
Because Helidon SE does not use annotation processing to identify endpoints, you need to
provide the CORS information for your application another way.

The high-level process for adding CORS support in your Helidon SE application is:

. Create a link:{javadoc-base-url-api}/CrossOriginConfig.html[`CrossOriginConfig`] instance for each type of resource sharing that you decided your application should provide.
The `CrossOriginConfig` Java class represents the details for a particular type of sharing.

. Create a link:{javadoc-base-url-api}/CorsSupport.html[`CorsSupport`] instance that includes the `CrossOriginConfig` instances from the previous step.
.  Use that `CorsSupport` instance to set up the routing rules.

Each of these classes has an associated builder.
// tag::config-table[]
The table below defines the methods on the `CrossOriginConfig.Builder` class and the configuration keys that map to the headers defined in the CORS protocol.

[width="100%",options="header"]
|====================
 Methods | Configuration Key | Default | CORS Header Name
 |`allowCredentials`|`allow-credentials`|`false`|`Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`
|`allowHeaders`|`allow-headers`|`["*"]`|`Access-Control-Allow-Headers`
|`allowMethods`|`allow-methods`|`["*"]`|`Access-Control-Allow-Methods`
|`allowOrigins`|`allow-origins`|`["*"]`|`Access-Control-Allow-Origins`
|`exposeHeaders`|`expose-headers`|`none`|`Access-COntrol-Expose-Headers`
|`maxAgeSeconds`|`max-age`|`3600`|`Access-Control-Max-Age`
|`enabled`|`enabled`|`true`|n/a|
|====================

If the cross-origin configuration is disabled (`enabled` = false), then the Helidon CORS implementation ignores the cross-origin configuration entry.
// end::config-table[]

== Sample Routing Setup Using the CrossOriginConfig API

In the link:{quickstart-example}[Helidon SE Quickstart application] you can change the greeting by sending a PUT request to the `/greet/greeting` resource.

In this example, we use the low-level `CrossOriginConfig` API and the `CorsSupport` API to influence the <<se/webserver/03_routing.adoc,routing>>,
thereby restricting how that resource is shared.

To understand how to use configuration instead of the low-level API, see <<se/cors/02_configuration.adoc, Using Configuration for CORS>>.

The following code shows how to prepare your application's routing to support metrics and health support as well as
CORS.

[[intro-quick-start-code-example]]
[source,java]
----
    private static Routing createRouting(Config config) {

        MetricsSupport metrics = MetricsSupport.create();
        GreetService greetService = new GreetService(config);
        HealthSupport health = HealthSupport.builder()
                .addLiveness(HealthChecks.healthChecks())   // Adds a convenient set of checks
                .build();
        CorsSupport corsSupport = CorsSupport.builder()  // <1>
                .addCrossOriginConfig(CrossOriginConfig.builder() // <2>
                            .allowOrigins("http://foo.com", "http://there.com") // <3>
                            .allowMethods("PUT", "DELETE") // <4>
                            .build())
                .addCrossOriginConfig(CrossOriginConfig.create()) // <5>
                .build();

        // Note: Add the CORS routing *before* registering the GreetService routing.
        return Routing.builder()
                .register(JsonSupport.create())
                .register(health)                   // Health at "/health"
                .register(metrics)                 // Metrics at "/metrics"
                .register("/greet", corsSupport, greetService) // <6>
                .build();
    }
----
<1> Create a `CorsSupport` instance using its builder.
<2> Add a `CrossOriginSupport` instance (using _its_ builder) to constrain resource sharing.
<3> List the origins (sites) allowed to share resources from this app.
<4> List the HTTP methods the constraint applies to.
<5> Add a `CrossOriginSupport` instance that permits all sharing (the default).
<6> Register the new `CorsSupport` instance with -- but in front of -- the service which implements the business logic.

The few additional lines identified above allow the application to participate in CORS.
