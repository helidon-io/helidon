= Using Configuration for CORS

Your application can use configuration in setting up CORS behavior.

== Understanding CORS Configuration Formats [[cors-configuration-formats]]
The support in Helidon for CORS configuration works with two closely-related formats. Each corresponds to a class
in the Helidon CORS library which holds CORS information.
// tag::basic-config[]

=== Basic Cross-Origin Configuration
Cross-origin configuration is the basic building block of CORS information. The table below defines the methods on the `CrossOriginConfig.Builder` class and the configuration keys that map to the headers defined in the CORS protocol.
[[config-key-table]]
[width="100%",options="header"]
|====================
 Methods | Configuration Key | Default | CORS Header Name
 |`allowCredentials`|`allow-credentials`|`false`|`Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`
|`allowHeaders`|`allow-headers`|`["*"]`|`Access-Control-Allow-Headers`
|`allowMethods`|`allow-methods`|`["*"]`|`Access-Control-Allow-Methods`
|`allowOrigins`|`allow-origins`|`["*"]`|`Access-Control-Allow-Origins`
|`exposeHeaders`|`expose-headers`|`none`|`Access-COntrol-Expose-Headers`
|`maxAgeSeconds`|`max-age`|`3600`|`Access-Control-Max-Age`
|`enabled`|`enabled`|`true`|n/a|
|====================
//include::{cors-se-intro}[tag=config-table]

If the cross-origin configuration is disabled (`enabled` = false), then the Helidon CORS implementation ignores the cross-origin configuration entry.

The following example, when loaded and used by the application, limits cross-origin resource sharing for `PUT` and
`DELETE` operations to only `foo.com` and `there.com`:

[source,hocon]
----
...
restrictive-cors:
  allow-origins: ["http://foo.com", "http://there.com"]
  allow-methods: ["PUT", "DELETE"]
...
----
// tag::mapped-config[]

=== Mapped Cross-Origin Configuration
In some cases, you or your users might want to configure CORS behavior based on URL path matching. The following example of the  _mapped_
configuration format illustrates this.

[source,hocon]
----
...
my-cors:
  paths:
    - path-prefix: /greeting <1>
      allow-origins: ["http://foo.com", "http://there.com", "http://other.com"]
      allow-methods: ["PUT", "DELETE"]
    - path-prefix: / <2>
      allow-methods: ["GET", "HEAD", "OPTIONS", "POST"]
...
----
<1> Sets restrictions on CORS for the `/greeting` path.
<2> Permits sharing of resources at the top-level path with all origins (the default) for the indicated HTTP methods.
CORS would be denied to `PATCH` HTTP requests.

Path expressions can be any expression accepted by the
link:{javadoc-base-url-webserver}/PathMatcher.html[`PathMatcher`] class.

Arrange the entries in the order that you want Helidon to check them. Usually this is from most specific to most general.
Helidon CORS support searches the cross-origin entries in the order you define them until it finds an entry that
matches an incoming request's path expression and HTTP method.
// end::mapped-config[]

You might want to avoid using mapped configuration to set up the _normal_ CORS behavior in your application, because you have to
make sure the paths are the same in the configuration and in the code that establishes routing for your application.
You _can_ use mapped configuration to your advantage if you want to allow your users to override the CORS behavior set up
in the application code. See the example below.

== Using CORS Configuration From the Application
To use basic or mapped CORS configuration, you add logic to your application to load sections of configuration and
use the loaded config to build `CrossOriginConfig` instances. (The
<<se/cors/01_introduction.adoc#intro-quick-start-code-example, `CrossOriginConfig` Routing Example>> shows
this in practice.)

You can create
a `CrossOriginConfig` instance directly from a config node, as shown in this example.

[source,java]
----
CorsSupport.Builder builder = CorsSupport.builder();

Config config = Config.create(); // Created from the current config sources

config.get("my-cors") // <1>
    .ifExists(builder::mappedConfig);

config.get("restrictive-cors") // <2>
    .ifExists(builder::config);

builder.addCrossOriginConfig(CrossOriginConfig.create()); // <3>

CorsSupport corsSupport = builder.build(); // <4>
----
<1> If `my-cors` exists in the configuration, use it to add mapped CORS config to the `CorsSupport` builder.
<2> If `restrictive-cors` exists in the configuration, use it to add basic (not mapped) config to the builder.
<3> Provide default CORS handling for requests that do not match earlier entries.
<4> Obtain the finished `CorsSupport` instance, suitable for use in creating the application's routing.

As each request arrives, Helidon checks it against the cross-origin config instances in the order that your application added them to the `CorsSupport.Builder`. The `my-cors` mapped configuration acts as an override because the application added it to the builder first.
