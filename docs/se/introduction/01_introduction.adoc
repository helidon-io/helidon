Helidon is a collection of Java libraries for writing microservices. Helidon
offers two programming models: Helidion SE and Helidon MP.

== About Helidon SE Components

Helidon SE is a compact toolkit that embraces the latest Java SE features:
reactive streams, asynchrous and functional programming, and fluent-style
APIs.

The REST framework for Helidon SE is the Helidon WebServer. It's built on top
of Netty and uses a straight forward request routing API and supports a
number of additional Helidon features:

[cols="2,6"]
|=======
| Reactive Web Server 
|  WebServer provides an asynchonous and reactive API for creating web applications. The API is inspired by popular NodeJS and Java frameworks.
<<se/webserver/01_introduction.adoc, Learn more>>.

| Health Checks 
|  The health check API combines the statuses of all the dependencies that affect availability and the ability to perform correctly such as network latency and storage. <<se/health/01_health.adoc, Learn more>>.

| gRPC 
|  Helidon gRPC Server provides a framework for creating gRPC (general-purpose Remote Procedure Calls) applications.
<<se/grpc/01_introduction.adoc, Learn more>>.

|Configuration  
| The Config component provides a Java API to load and process configuration properties in key/value form into a Config object which the application can use to retrieve config data.
<<se/config/01_introduction.adoc, Learn more>>. 

| Metrics 
|  Heldion supports both a base set and a Helidon-specific set of metrics that expose information in JSON format (as specified by the MicroProfile Metrics specification) or in plain text (for Prometheus metrics). 
<<se/metrics/01_metrics.adoc, Learn more>>.

| Helidon DB Client 
|  The new Helidon SE DB Client for Helidon 2.0 provides a unified, reactive API for working with databases in non-blocking way. 
<<se/dbclient/01_introduction.adoc, Learn more>>.

| Security 
|  The security modules modules support authentication, authorization, outbound security and audits for your applications.
<<se/security/01_introduction.adoc, Learn more>>.

|  CORS Support
|  Although it is possible for any Helidon application to implement its own support for CORS, there are common tasks (such as processing preflight requests) that can be provided in a Helidon module. <<se/cors/01_introduction.adoc, Learn more>>. 

| OpenTracing 
|  Helidon includes support for tracing through the OpenTracing APIs. Tracing is integrated with WebServer, gRPC Server, and Security.
<<se/tracing/01_tracing.adoc, Learn more>>.

| Helidon Web Client 
|  The new Helidon WebClient for Helidon SE 2.0 allows you to perform any HTTP requests to the target endpoint (via GET, PUT, etc.), and handle the provided response in a reactive way.
<<se/webclient/01_introduction.adoc, Learn more>>.

|OpenAPI  
|  The OpenAPI in Helidon SE allows your Helidon SE application to serve an OpenAPI document that describes your applicationâ€™s endpoints.
<<se/openapi/01_openapi.adoc, Learn more>>.

| GraalVM Native Image support 
|  Helidon SE supports GraalVM native images for small footprint and lightening fast startup. <<se/guides/36_graalnative.adoc,Learn more>>.

| Netty I/O Client-Server Framework 
|  Helidon runs on top of Netty so there is no need for an application server. It is not derived from a Java EE application server. That means your cloud native application is compact and efficient without unnecessary overhead or bloat.

|JSON-P and JSON-B  
|  Helidon supports both JSON processing (JSON P) and JSON building (JSON B) APIs.
