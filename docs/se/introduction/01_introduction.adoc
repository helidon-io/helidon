= About Helidon SE
:description: Helidon SE Introduction
:keywords: helidon, java, microservices, microprofile


Helidon is a collection of Java libraries for writing microservices. Helidon
offers two programming models: Helidion SE and <<mp/introduction/01_introduction.adoc,Helidon MP>>.

== Helidon SE Components

Helidon SE is a compact toolkit that embraces the latest Java SE features:
reactive streams, asynchrous and functional programming, and fluent style
APIs.

The REST framework for Helidon SE is the Helidon WebServer. It's built on top
of Netty and uses a straight forward request routing API and supports a
number of additional Helidon features:

* *Reactive Web Server* +
WebServer provides an asynchonous and reactive API for creating web applications. The API is inspired by popular NodeJS and Java frameworks.
http://se/webserver/01_introduction.adoc[Learn more].

* *Health Checks* +
The health check API combines the statuses of all the dependencies that affect availability and the ability to perform correctly such as network latency and storage. http://se/health/01_health.adoc[Learn more].


* *gRPC*  +
Helidon gRPC Server provides a framework for creating gRPC (general-purpose Remote Procedure Calls) applications.
http://se/grpc/01_introduction.adoc[Learn more]. 

* *Config* +
The configuration component provides a Java API to load and process configuration properties in key/value form into a Config object which the application can use to retrieve config data.
http://se/config/introduction.adoc[Learn more].

* *Metrics* +
Heldion supports both a base set and a Helidon-specific set of metrics that expose information in JSON format (as specified by the MicroProfile Metrics specification) or in plain text (for Prometheus metrics). 
http://se/metrics/01_metrics.adoc[Learn more].

* *Helidon DB Client* +
The new Helidon SE DB Client for Helidon 2.0 provides a unified, reactive API for working with databases in non-blocking way. 
http://se/dbclient/01_introduction.adoc[Learn more].

* *Security* +
The security modules modules support authentication, authorization, outbound security and audits for your applications.
http://se/security/01_introduction.adoc[Learn more].


* *OpenTracing* +
Helidon includes support for tracing through the OpenTracing APIs. Tracing is integrated with WebServer, gRPC Server, and Security.

* *Helidon Web Client* +
The new Helidon WebClient for Helidon SE 2.0 allows you to perform any HTTP requests to the target endpoint (via GET, PUT, etc.), and handle the provided response in a reactive way.

* *OpenAPI* +
The OpenAPI in Helidon SE allows your Helidon SE application to serve an OpenAPI document that describes your application’s endpoints.


* JSON-P +

* JSON-B

For details see the Helidon <<about/01_overview.adoc,documentation>> and
<<guides/01_overview.adoc,guides>>.

== GraalVM Native Image support

Helidon SE supports https://www.graalvm.org[GraalVM]
https://www.graalvm.org/docs/reference-manual/native-image/[native images]
for small footprint and lightening fast startup. For more information see
the <<guides/36_graalnative.adoc,Graal native image guide>>.

== No Application Server

Helidon is a collection of libraries that runs on top of Netty.
It is not derived from a Java EE
application server. That means your cloud native application is compact
and efficient without unnecessary overhead or bloat.

Try the <<guides/02_quickstart-se.adoc,Helidon SE quickstart>> to get your
first Helidon SE application up and running in minutes.
