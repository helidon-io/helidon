== Overview

WebClient is an HTTP client for Helidon SE. It can be used to send requests and retrieve corresponding responses in a programmatic way.

Helidon WebClient provides the following features:

* *Blocking approach* +
The Webclient uses the blocking approach to synchronously process a request and its correspond response. Both `HTTP/1.1` and `HTTP/2` request and response will run in the thread of the user. Additionally, for `HTTP/2`, virtual thread is employed to manage the connection.

* *Builder-like setup and execution* +
Creates every client and request as a builder pattern. This improves readability and code maintenance.

* *Redirect chain* +
Follows the redirect chain and perform requests on the correct endpoint by itself.

* *Tracing and security propagation* +
Automatically propagates the configured tracing and security settings of the Helidon WebServer to the WebClient and uses them during request and response.

----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.webclient</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-webclient</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

The `helidon-webclient` dependency has built-in support for `HTTP/1.1`.

If support for `HTTP/2` is a requirement, below dependency needs to be added:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.webclient</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-webclient-http2</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

== Usage

=== Instantiating the WebClient

You can create an instance of a WebClient by executing `WebClient.create()` which will have default settings and without a base uri set.

To change the default settings and register
additional services, you can use simple builder that allows you to customize the client behavior.

.Create a WebClient with simple builder:
[source,java]
----
WebClient client = WebClient.builder()
        .baseUri("http://localhost")
        .build();
----

=== Creating the Request

WebClient offers a set of request methods that are used to specify the type of action to be performed on a given resource. Below are some examples of request methods:

* `get()`
* `post()`
* `put()`
* `method(String methodName)`

Check out link:{webclient-javadoc-base-url}.api/io/helidon/webclient/api/HttpClient.html[HttpClient.html] API to learn more about request methods. These methods will create a new instance of link:{webclient-javadoc-base-url}.api/io/helidon/webclient/api/HttpClientRequest.html[HttpClientRequest] which can then be configured to add optional settings that will customize the behavior of the request.

=== Customizing the Request

Configuration can be set for every request type before it is sent. Below are some examples of the optional parameters.

|===
|Parameter |Description

|`uri("http://example.com")`   |Overrides baseUri from WebClient
|`path("/path")`   |Adds path to the uri
|`queryParam("query", "parameter")`   |Adds query parameter to the request
|`fragment("someFragment")`   |Adds fragment to the request
|`headers(headers -> headers.addAccept(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON))`   |Adds header to the request
|===

For more information about these optional parameters, check out link:{webclient-javadoc-base-url}.api/io/helidon/webclient/api/ClientRequestBase.html[ClientRequestBase] API, which is a parent class of link:{webclient-javadoc-base-url}.api/io/helidon/webclient/api/HttpClientRequest.html[HttpClientRequest].

link:{webclient-javadoc-base-url}.api/io/helidon/webclient/api/HttpClientRequest.html[HttpClientRequest] class also provides specific header methods that help the user to set a particular header. Some examples of these are:

* `contentType` (MediaType contentType)
* `accept` (MediaType... mediaTypes)

For more information about these methods, check out  link:{webclient-javadoc-base-url}.api/io/helidon/webclient/api/ClientRequest.html[ClientRequest] API, which is a parent class of link:{webclient-javadoc-base-url}.api/io/helidon/webclient/api/HttpClientRequest.html[HttpClientRequest].

=== Sending the Request

Once the request setup is completed, the following methods can be used to send it:

* `HttpClientResponse request()`
* `<E> ClientResponseTyped<E> request(Class<E> type)`
* `<E> E requestEntity(Class<E> type)`
* `HttpClientResponse submit(Object entity)`
* `<T> ClientResponseTyped<T> submit(Object entity, Class<T> requestedType)`
* `HttpClientResponse outputStream(OutputStreamHandler outputStreamConsumer)`
* `<T> ClientResponseTyped<T> outputStream(OutputStreamHandler outputStreamConsumer, Class<T> requestedType)`

Each of the methods will provide a way to allow response to be retrieved in a particular response type. Refer to link:{webclient-javadoc-base-url}..api/io/helidon/webclient/api/ClientRequest.html[ClientRequest API] for more details about these methods.

.Execute a simple GET request to endpoint and receive a String response:
[source,java]
----
ClientResponseTyped<String> response = webClient.get()
                .path("/endpoint")
                .request(String.class);
String entityString = response.entity();
----

=== Protocol used
Webclient currently supports `HTTP/1.1` and `HTTP/2` protocols. Below are the rules on which specific protocol will be used:

* Using plain socket triggers WebClient to process a request using `HTTP/1.1`.
* When using TLS, the client will use ALPN (protocol negotiation) to use appropriate HTTP version (either 1.1, or 2). `HTTP/2` has a higher weight, so it is chosen if supported by both sides.
* A specific protocol can be explicitly selected by calling `HttpClientRequest#protocolId(String)`.
[source,java]
----
String result = webClient.get()
                         .protocolId("http/1.1")
                         .requestEntity(String.class);
----
* If `HTTP/2` is used, an upgrade attempt will be performed. If it fails, the client falls-back to `HTTP/1.1`.
* The parameter `prior-knowledge` can be defined using `HTTP/2` protocol configuration. Please refer to <<Setting Protocol configuration>> on how to customize `HTTP/2`. In such a case, `prior-knowledge` will be used and fail if it is unable to switch to `HTTP/2`.

=== Adding Media Support to the WebClient

Webclient supports the following built-in Helidon Media Support libraries:

1. JSON Processing (JSON-P)
2. JSON Binding (JSON-B)
3. Jackson

They can be activated by adding their corresponding libraries into the classpath. This can simply be done by adding their corresponding dependencies.

.Add JSON-P support:
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.http.media</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-http-media-jsonp</artifactId>
</dependency>
----
.Add JSON-B support:
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.http.media</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-http-media-jsonb</artifactId>
</dependency>
----
.Add Jackson support:
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.http.media</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-http-media-jackson</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Users can also create their own Custom Media Support library and make them work by following either of the approaches:

* Create a Provider of the Custom Media Support and expose it via Service Loader followed by adding the Media Support library to the classpath.
* Explicitly register the Custom Media Support from WebClient.

[source,java]
----
WebClient webclient = WebClient.builder()
        .mediaContext(MediaContext.builder()
                .addMediaSupport(CustomMediaSupport.create())   <1>
                .build())
        .build()
----
<1> Register CustomMedia support from the WebClient.

=== DNS Resolving

Webclient provides three DNS resolver implementations out of the box:

* `Java DNS resolution` is the default.
* `*First* DNS resolution` uses the first IP address from a DNS lookup. To enable this option, add below dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.webclient.dns.resolver</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-webclient-dns-resolver-first</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

* `*Round-Robin* DNS resolution` cycles through IP addresses from a DNS lookup. To enable this option, add this dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.webclient.dns.resolver</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-webclient-dns-resolver-round-robin</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

=== Adding Service


== Configuring the WebClient

The class responsible for WebClient configuration is:

include::{rootdir}/config/io_helidon_webclient_api_WebClient.adoc[leveloffset=+1,tag=config]

=== Protocol Specific Configuration

Protocol specific configuration can be set using the  `protocol-configs` parameter. Webclient currently supports `HTTP/1.1.` and `HTTP/2`. Below are the options for each of the protocol type:

* `HTTP/1.1`

include::{rootdir}/config/io_helidon_webclient_http1_Http1ClientProtocolConfig.adoc[leveloffset=2,tag=config]


* `HTTP/2`

include::{rootdir}/config/io_helidon_webclient_http2_Http2ClientProtocolConfig.adoc[leveloffset=2,tag=config]

=== Example of a WebClient Runtime Configuration

[source,java]
----
Config config = Config.create();
WebClient client = WebClient.builder()
        .baseUri("http://localhost")
        .config(config.get("client"))
        .build();
----

<7> TLS configuration

== Examples

=== Webclient with Proxy
Configure Proxy setup either programmatically or via the Helidon configuration framework.

==== Configuring Proxy in your code
Proxy can be set directly from WebClient builder.
[source,java]
----
Proxy proxy = Proxy.builder()
                .type(Proxy.ProxyType.HTTP)
                .host(PROXY_HOST)
                .port(PROXY_PORT)
                .build();
WebClient webClient = WebClient.builder()
         .proxy(proxy)
         .build();
----

Alternative is to set proxy directly from the request via  `HttpClientRequest`.

[source,java]
----
// Using System Proxy
Proxy proxy = Proxy.create();
System.setProperty("http.proxyHost", PROXY_HOST);
System.setProperty("http.proxyPort", PROXY_PORT);
System.setProperty("http.nonProxyHosts", "localhost|127.0.0.1|10.*.*.*|*.example.com|etc|" + TARGET_HOST);
webClient.get("/proxiedresource").proxy(proxy).request()
----

==== Configuring Proxy in the config file

Proxy can also be configured in WebClient through the `application.yaml` configuration file.

[source,yaml]
.WebClient Proxy configuration in `application.yaml`
----
webclient:
  proxy:
    host: "hostName"
    port: 80
    no-proxy: ["localhost:8080", ".helidon.io", "192.168.1.1"]
----
Then, in your application code, load the configuration from that file.

[source,java]
.WebClient initialization using the `application.yaml` file located on the classpath
----
Config config = Config.create();
WebClient webClient = WebClient.create(config.get("webclient"));
----


=== WebClient TLS setup

Configure TLS either programmatically or by the Helidon configuration framework.

==== Configuring TLS in your code

One way to configure TLS in WebClient is in your application code as shown below.

[source,java]
----
WebClient.builder()
         .tls(Tls.builder()
                     .trust(trust -> trust
                             .keystore(store -> store
                                     .passphrase("password")
                                     .trustStore(true)
                                     .keystore(Resource.create("client.p12"))))
                     .build())
         .build();
----

==== Configuring TLS in the config file

Another way to configure TLS in WebClient is through the `application.yaml` configuration file.

[source,yaml]
.WebClient TLS configuration in `application.yaml`
----
webclient:
  tls:
    trust:
      keystore:
        passphrase: "password"
        trust-store: true
        resource:
          resource-path: "client.p12"
----
Then, in your application code, load the configuration from that file.

[source,java]
.WebClient initialization using the `application.yaml` file located on the classpath
----
Config config = Config.create();
WebClient webClient = WebClient.create(config.get("webclient"));
----

=== Adding Service to WebClient

WebClient currently supports 3 built-in services namely `metrics`, `tracing` and `security`.

==== Enabling the service

In order for a service to function, their dependency needs to be added in the application's pom.xml. Below are examples on how to enable the built-in services:

* `metrics`
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.webclient</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-webclient-metrics</artifactId>
</dependency>
----
* `tracing`
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.webclient</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-webclient-tracing</artifactId>
</dependency>
----
* `security`
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.webclient</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-webclient-security</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

==== Adding a service in your code

Services can be added in WebClient as shown in the code below.

[source,java]
----
//Creates new metric which will count all GET requests and has format of example.metric.GET.<host-name>
WebClientService clientService = WebClientMetrics.counter()
        .methods(Method.GET)
        .nameFormat("example.metric.%1$s.%2$s")
        .build();

//This newly created metric now needs to be registered to WebClient.
WebClient client = WebClient.builder()
        .baseUri(url)
        .config(config)
        .addService(clientService)
        .build();
----

==== Adding service in the config file

Adding service in WebClient can also be done through the `application.yaml` configuration file.

[source,yaml]
.WebClient Service configuration in `application.yaml`
----
webclient:
  services:
    metrics:
      - type: METER
        name-format: "client.meter.overall"
      - type: TIMER
        # meter per method
        name-format: "client.meter.%1$s"
      - methods: ["PUT", "POST", "DELETE"]
        type: COUNTER
        success: false
        name-format: "wc.counter.%1$s.error"
        description: "Counter of failed PUT, POST and DELETE requests"
    tracing:
----
Then, in your application code, load the configuration from that file.

[source,java]
.WebClient initialization using the `application.yaml` file located on the classpath
----
Config config = Config.create();
WebClient webClient = WebClient.create(config.get("webclient"));
----

=== Setting Protocol configuration
Individual protocols can be customized using the `protocol-config` parameter.

==== Setting up protocol configuration in your code

Below is an example of customizing `HTTP/1.1` protocol in the application code.

[source,java]
----
WebClient client = WebClient.builder()
    .baseUri(url)
    .config(config.get("client"))
    .addProtocolConfig(Http1ClientProtocolConfig.builder()
                    .defaultKeepAlive(false)
                    .validateRequestHeaders(true)
                    .validateResponseHeaders(false)
                    .build())
    .build();
----

==== Setting up protocol configuration in the config file

Protocol configuration can also be set in the `application.yaml` configuration file.

[source,yaml]
.Setting up `HTTP/1.1` and `HTTP/2` protocol using `application.yaml` file.
----
webclient:
  protocol-configs:
    http_1_1:
      max-header-size: 20000
      validate-request-headers: true
    h2:
      prior-knowledge: true
----
Then, in your application code, load the configuration from that file.

[source,java]
.WebClient initialization using the `application.yaml` file located on the classpath
----
Config config = Config.create();
WebClient webClient = WebClient.create(config.get("webclient"));
----
