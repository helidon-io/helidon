.Optional configuration options
[cols="3,3a,2,5a"]

|===
|key |type |default value |description

|`backward-compatible-eol` |boolean |`false` |Enable support for Helidon versions before 3.0.0 (exclusive).

 Until version 3.0.0 (exclusive) there was a trailing end of line added to the signed
 data.
 To be able to communicate cross versions, we must configure this when talking to older versions of Helidon.
 Default value is `false`. In Helidon 2.x, this switch exists as well and the default is `true`, to
 allow communication between versions as needed.
|`headers` |HttpSignHeader[&#93; (SIGNATURE, AUTHORIZATION, CUSTOM) |{nbsp} |Add a header that is validated on inbound requests. Provider may support more than
 one header to validate.
|`inbound.keys` |xref:{rootdir}/config/io_helidon_security_providers_httpsign_InboundClientDefinition.adoc[InboundClientDefinition[&#93;] |{nbsp} |Add inbound configuration. This is used to validate signature and authenticate the
 party.

 The same can be done through configuration:
 <pre>
 {
  name = "http-signatures"
  class = "HttpSignProvider"
  http-signatures {
      inbound {
          # This configures the InboundClientDefinition
          keys: [
          {
              key-id = "service1"
              hmac.secret = "${CLEAR=password}"
          }]
      }
  }
 }
 </pre>
|`optional` |boolean |`true` |Set whether the signature is optional. If set to true (default), this provider will
 SecurityResponse.SecurityStatus#ABSTAIN from this request if signature is not
 present. If set to false, this provider will SecurityResponse.SecurityStatus#FAILURE fail
 if signature is not present.
|`outbound` |xref:{rootdir}/config/io_helidon_security_providers_common_OutboundConfig.adoc[OutboundConfig] |{nbsp} |Add outbound targets to this builder.
 The targets are used to chose what to do for outbound communication.
 The targets should have OutboundTargetDefinition attached through
 OutboundTarget.Builder#customObject(Class, Object) to tell us how to sign
 the request.

 The same can be done through configuration:
 <pre>
 {
  name = "http-signatures"
  class = "HttpSignProvider"
  http-signatures {
      targets: [
      {
          name = "service2"
          hosts = ["localhost"]
          paths = ["/service2/.*"]

          # This configures the OutboundTargetDefinition
          signature {
              key-id = "service1"
              hmac.secret = "${CLEAR=password}"
          }
      }]
  }
 }
 </pre>
|`realm` |string |`helidon` |Realm to use for challenging inbound requests that do not have "Authorization" header
 in case header is HttpSignHeader#AUTHORIZATION and singatures are not optional.
|`sign-headers` |xref:{rootdir}/config/io_helidon_security_providers_httpsign_SignedHeadersConfig_HeadersConfig.adoc[HeadersConfig[&#93;] |{nbsp} |Override the default inbound required headers (e.g. headers that MUST be signed and
 headers that MUST be signed IF present).

 Defaults:

- get, head, delete methods: date, (request-target), host are mandatory; authorization if present (unless we are
 creating/validating the HttpSignHeader#AUTHORIZATION ourselves
- put, post: same as above, with addition of: content-length, content-type and digest if present
 
- for other methods: date, (request-target)

Note that this provider DOES NOT validate the "Digest" HTTP header, only the signature.
