This is a standalone configuration type, prefix from configuration root: `server`



== Configuration options



.Optional configuration options
[cols="3,3a,2,5a"]

|===
|key |type |default value |description

|`backlog` |int |`1024` |Configures a maximum length of the queue of incoming connections on the server
 socket.

 Default value is #DEFAULT_BACKLOG_SIZE.
|[.line-through]#`bind-address`# |string |{nbsp} |*Deprecated* Configures local address where the server listens on with the server socket.
 If not configured, then listens an all local addresses.
|`enable-compression` |boolean |`false` |Enable negotiation for gzip/deflate content encodings. Clients can
 request compression using the "Accept-Encoding" header.

 Default is `false`
|`features.print-details` |boolean |`false` |Set to `true` to print detailed feature information on startup.
|`host` |string |{nbsp} |A helper method that just calls #bindAddress(String).
|`max-header-size` |int |`16384` |Maximal number of bytes of all header values combined. When a bigger value is received, a
 io.helidon.common.http.Http.Status#BAD_REQUEST_400
 is returned.

 Default is `8192`
|`max-initial-line-length` |int |`4096` |Maximal number of characters in the initial HTTP line.

 Default is `4096`
|`max-payload-size` |long |{nbsp} |Set a maximum payload size for a client request. Can prevent DoS
 attacks.
|`max-upgrade-content-length` |int |`65536` |Set a maximum length of the content of an upgrade request.

 Default is `64*1024`
|`backpressure-buffer-size` |long |`5242880` |Set a maximum length of the unflushed response data sending buffer can keep without applying backpressure.
Depends on `backpressure-policy` what happens if max buffer size is reached.

 Default is `5*1024*1024` - 5Mb
|`backpressure-policy` | String | `LINEAR` |Sets the strategy for applying backpressure to the reactive stream
of response data.

* LINEAR - Data chunks are requested one-by-one after previous data chunk has been written to Netty's buffer, when
`backpressure-buffer-size` watermark is reached, new chunks are not requested until buffer size decrease under
the watermark value.
* PREFETCH - After first data chunk arrives, expected number of chunks needed to fill the buffer up
to watermark is calculated and requested.
* AUTO_FLUSH - Data are requested one-by-one, in case buffer reaches watermark, no other data is requested and extra flush is initiated.
* UNBOUNDED - No backpressure is applied, Long.MAX_VALUE(unbounded) is requested from upstream.

 Default is `LINEAR`
|`port` |int |`0` |Configures a server port to listen on with the server socket. If port is
 `0` then any available ephemeral port will be used.
|`receive-buffer-size` |int |{nbsp} |Configures proposed value of the TCP receive window that is advertised to the remote peer on the
 server socket.

 If `0` then use implementation default.
|`sockets` |xref:{rootdir}/config/io_helidon_webserver_SocketConfiguration.adoc[SocketConfiguration[&#93;] |{nbsp} |Adds an additional named server socket configuration. As a result, the server will listen
 on multiple ports.

 An additional named server socket may have a dedicated Routing configured
 through io.helidon.webserver.WebServer.Builder#addNamedRouting(String, Routing).
|`timeout-millis` |long |`0` |Socket timeout in milliseconds
|`tls` |xref:{rootdir}/config/io_helidon_webserver_WebServerTls.adoc[WebServerTls] |{nbsp} |Configures SSL for this socket. When configured, the server enforces SSL
 configuration.
 If this method is called, any other method except for #tls(java.util.function.Supplier)Â¨
 and repeated invocation of this method would be ignored.

 If this method is called again, the previous configuration would be ignored.
|`worker-count` |int |{nbsp} |Sets a count of threads in pool used to process HTTP requests.
 Default value is `CPU_COUNT * 2`.

 Configuration key: `workers`
