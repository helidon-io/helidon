== What is Helidon?

link:https://helidon.io[Helidon] is a collection of Java libraries for writing microservices that run on a fast web core powered by link:https://netty.io[Netty]. It's small, fast and fun to use. 

Helison is open source under Alache 2.0 license. Sources are available on link:{helidon-github-tree-url}[GitHub].

Helidon is cloud-native ready. It provides fast start-up time, has low memory consumption and small disk footprint. It also comes with full observability stack out of the box including Health Checks, Metrics , Tracing and Logging.

Helidon fully supports GraalVM native-image allowing you to build native executable out of your Java application.

Helidon has minimum number of third-party dependencies by design.

== Helidon Flavors

Helidon comes in two flavors: *Helison SE* and *Helidon MP*. Think about flavors as frameworks providing similar functionality using differet development experience.

[cols="3,3"]
|====================
| *Helidon SE* |  *Helidon MP*

|Helidon SE gives you full transparency and puts you in control.
|Helidon MP is built on top of the Helidon SE libraries and provides platform definition that is familiar to enterprise Java developers.

|Microframework model with a very small footprint and limited functionality (~7 MB) 
| https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/eclipse-microprofile[MicroProfile] implementation; slightly larger footprint than SE (~13 MB)

|Functional style, reactive, non-blocking   
|Declarative style with dependency injection

|Transparent "no magic" development experience; pure java application development with no annotations and no dependency injections  
|Spring Boot, Jakarta EE and MicroProfile development experience; Jakarta EE components (CDI, JAX-RS, JSON-P/B)

|====================

To better understand differences below are two samples implementing a simple RESTful service. One is using Helidon SE, another Helidon MP.

.Helidon SE sample
[source,java]
----
Routing routing = Routing.builder()
    .get("/hello", 
        (req, res) -> res.send("Hello World"))
    .build();

WebServer.create(routing)
    .start();
----

.Helidon MP sample
[source,java]
----
@Path("hello")
public class HelloWorld {
    @GET
    public String hello() {
        return "Hello World";
    }
}
----

=== What flavor shall I use?

Use Helidon SE if

- Performance is your main goal
- You are familiar with Reactive Programming
- Your application is heavily using concurrency
- You are not planning to use any CDI based components
- You want to use minimum number of third-party dependencies

Use Helidon MP if

- You want to base your application on modern enterprise Java standards such as Jakarta EE and MicroProfile
- You are familiar with Java EE, Jakarta EE or Spring Boot and would like to use similar development experience
- You are migrating existing Java EE/Jakarta EE application to microservices
- You are planning to use CDI components or extensions
- You are planning to use JPA for data access and Jersey (JAX-RS) for RESTful services


[NOTE]
====
If you don't know which Helidon flavor to use â€“ use *Helidon MP*
====

=== Next Steps

Next would be to choose a Helidon flavor and start using it. Check the following
