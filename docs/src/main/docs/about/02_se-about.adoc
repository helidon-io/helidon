== Helidon SE

Helidon is a collection of Java libraries for writing microservices. Helidon
offers two programming models: Helidion SE and <<about/02_mp-about.adoc,Helidon MP>>.

Helidon SE is a compact toolkit that embraces the latest Java SE features:
reactive streams, asynchrous and functional programming, and fluent style
APIs.

The REST framework for Helidon SE is the Helidon WebServer. It's built on top
of Netty and uses a straight forward request routing API and supports a
number of additional Helidon features:

* Config
* Security
* Health
* Metrics
* OpenAPI
* OpenTracing
* JSON-P
* JSON-B

For details see the Helidon <<about/01_overview.adoc,documentation>> and
<<guides/01_overview.adoc,guides>>.

== GraalVM Native Image support

Helidon SE supports https://www.graalvm.org[GraalVM]
https://www.graalvm.org/docs/reference-manual/native-image/[native images]
for small footprint and lightening fast startup. For more information see
the <<guides/36_graalnative.adoc,Graal native image guide>>.

== No Application Server

Helidon is a collection of libraries that runs on top of Netty.
It is not derived from a Java EE
application server. That means your cloud native application is compact
and efficient without unnecessary overhead or bloat.
