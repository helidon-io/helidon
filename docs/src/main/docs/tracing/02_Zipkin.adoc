= Zipkin Tracing
:description: Helidon Tracing Support
= :keywords: helidon, tracing

== Zipkin Tracing
Helidon SE is integrated with Zipkin tracer.

The Zipkin builder is loaded through `ServiceLoader` and configured. You could
also use the Zipkin builder directly, though this would create a source-code dependency
on Zipkin tracer.


=== Maven Coordinates
To use Zipkin as the collector of traces (e.g. a Tracer),
    add the following dependency to your project:

[source,xml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
.Zipkin Tracer
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.tracing</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-tracing-zipkin</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

=== Configuring Zipkin

The following configuration options are supported by Zipkin tracer:

|path           |defined by version |collectorPath      |path of the Zipkin trace collector
|api-version    |Version.V2         |version            |Zipkin specific method, set the prtocol version to communicate with trace collector
|enabled        |true               |enabled            |if set to false, tracing would be disabled
|tags           |N/A                |addTracerTag(String, String) |String tags to add to each span
