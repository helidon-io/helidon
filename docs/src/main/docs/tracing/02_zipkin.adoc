= Zipkin Tracing
:description: Helidon Tracing Support
:keywords: helidon, tracing, zipkin

Helidon is integrated with the Zipkin tracer.

The Zipkin builder is loaded through `ServiceLoader` and configured. You could
also use the Zipkin builder directly, though this would create a source-code dependency
on the Zipkin tracer.


== Prerequisites
To use Zipkin as a tracer,
    add the following dependency to your project:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.tracing</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-tracing-zipkin</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

== Configuring Zipkin

The Zipkin tracer supports the following configuration options:

|===
|Key            |Default value      |Builder method     |Description

|service        |N/A                |serviceName        |Name of the service, to distinguish traces crossing service boundaries;
                                                            Zipkin is using lower-case only, name will be automatically lower-cased
|protocol       |http               |collectorProtocol  |Protocol of the Zipkin trace collector (http or https)
|host           |localhost          |collectorHost      |Host of the Zipkin trace collector (IP Address, hostname, or FQDN)
|port           |9411               |collectorPort      |Port of the Zipkin trace collector
|path           |defined by version |collectorPath      |Path of the Zipkin trace collector, each version uses a different path
                                                            by default.
|api-version    |2                  |version            |Zipkin specific method, set the protocol version to communicate with
                                                            trace collector
|enabled        |true               |enabled            |If set to false, tracing would be disabled
|tags           |N/A                |addTracerTag(String, String) |`String` tags to add to each span
|boolean-tags   |N/A                |addTracerTag(String, boolean)|`boolean` tags to add to each span
|int-tags       |N/A                |addTracerTag(String, int)    |`int` tags to add to each span
|===

The following is an example of a Zipkin configuration, specified in the YAML format.
[source,yaml]
----
tracing:
  zipkin:
    service: "helidon-service"
    protocol: "https"
    host: "192.168.1.1"
    port: 9987
    api-version: 1
    # this is the default path for API version 2
    path: "/api/v2/spans"
    tags:
      tag1: "tag1-value"
      tag2: "tag2-value"
    boolean-tags:
      tag3: true
      tag4: false
    int-tags:
      tag5: 145
      tag6: 741
