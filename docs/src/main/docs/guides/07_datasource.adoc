= Setting Up Data Sources
:description: Helidon MP Data Source Guide
:keywords: helidon, guide, datasource, microprofile

This guide shows how to configure and use named
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/sql/DataSource.html[`DataSource`]s
in your Helidon MP application.

== What You Need

|===
|About 20 minutes
|<<about/03_prerequisites.adoc,Helidon Prerequisites>>
|The Maven coordinates for your database vendor's JDBC-compliant database driver library
|===

== What You'll Do

By following this guide, you'll enhance a bare-bones Helidon MP
application to access a database.  You'll see how to install the
relevant dependencies, set up and configure the datasource, and add
datasource-related code to your application.

== Use the Maven Archetype to Generate a Helidon MP Application

#Archetype instructions go here#

== Add Your Database Driver to Your Helidon MP Application's Runtime Classpath

In this guide, we'll use the H2 database.

Add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.h2database</groupId>
    <artifactId>h2</artifactId>
    <version>1.4.199</version>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
----

In a production application, you may use a different database, so you
may add a different database driver dependency here instead.

== Add a Helidon Connection Pool Extension to Your Helidon MP Application's Runtime Classpath

Helidon contains two <<extensions/01_overview.adoc,extensions>> that
supply _connection pools_, infrastructure that allows efficient use of
database connections:

1. <<extensions/02_cdi_datasource-hikaricp.adoc,HikariCP extension>>:
   an extension that integrates the
   https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP[Hikari connection pool]
   into Helidon MP applications

2. <<extensions/02_cdi_datasource-ucp.adoc,Oracle Universal Connection
   Pool extension>>: an extension that integrates
   https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/jjucp/index.html[Oracle's
   Universal Connection Pool] into Helidon MP applications

Each connection pool offers tradeoffs in terms of size, efficiency and
features.  You need to pick one to use.

=== Add the Hikari Connection Pool to the Runtime Classpath

If you choose to integrate the Hikari connection pool into your
Helidon MP application, then add an appropriate `<dependency>`
element as a child element of the `<dependencies>` element in your
`pom.xml`, referencing the HikariCP extension:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.integrations.cdi</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-integrations-cdi-datasource-hikaricp</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
----

=== Add the Oracle Universal Connection Pool to the Runtime Classpath

If, instead, you choose to integrate the Oracle Universal Connection
Pool into your Helidon MP application, then add an appropriate
`<dependency>` element as a child element of the `<dependencies>`
element in your `pom.xml`, referencing the Oracle Universal Connection
Pool extension:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.integrations.cdi</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-integrations-cdi-datasource-ucp</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
----

== Configure the Connection Pool

Regardless of which connection pool you integrate into your Helidon MP
application, you will need to tell it how many data sources to set up,
what to name each of them so you can refer to them inside your code,
and how each of them should connect to a database.

In this guide, we'll set up configuration in an `application.yaml`
classpath resource.  Different syntax may apply if you use a different
MicroProfile Config
https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/blob/master/spec/src/main/asciidoc/configsources.asciidoc#configsources[`ConfigSource`
implementation], but the principles described below are the same.  You
can see <<microprofile/06_configuration.adoc,the Helidon MP
configuration documentation>> for more details.

=== Configure the Hikari Connection Pool

If you have chosen to integrate the Hikari connection pool into your
Helidon MP application, then ensure the following YAML is present in
your `application.yaml`, and that your `application.yaml` is present
on the runtime classpath of your Helidon MP application by creating it
in `src/main/resources`:

[source,yaml]
----
javax:
  sql:
    DataSource: <1>
      test: <2>
        dataSourceClassName: org.h2.jdbcx.JdbcDataSource <3>
        dataSource: <4>
          password: ""
          url: jdbc:h2:mem:test
          user: sa
----

<1> The YAML consisting of a top level `javax`
https://yaml.org/spec/1.1/current.html#key/information%20model[mapping]
whose sole element is a `sql` mapping whose sole mapping is a
`DataSource` mapping corresponds to the Java type of
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/sql/DataSource.html[`javax.sql.DataSource`].
This preamble specifies the type of Java object that will supply
database connections in your code.  Its sole element is a mapping
whose key is the name of the data source in question.  This
`javax:` / `sql:` / `DataSource:` preamble is required.

<2> This mapping's key is the name of your data source, and will be
referenced in your application code.  Its elements are
https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP/blob/dev/README.md#configuration-knobs-baby[Hikari
connection pool properties].  The data source name may be anything you
like.  By convention, data source names are usually single words
consisting of alphanumeric characters only.

<3> This is the class name of the actual
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/sql/DataSource.html[`javax.sql.DataSource`]
implementation provided by your database vendor.  In this example,
which uses the https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html[H2 database],
the class name in question is
https://www.h2database.com/javadoc/org/h2/jdbcx/JdbcDataSource.html[`org.h2.jdbcx.JdbcDataSource`].

<4> The Hikari connection pool reserves the keyword `dataSource` as an
indicator that the property names that follow are
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/javabeans/writing/properties.html[Java
Bean properties] of the class denoted by the value of the
`dataSourceClassName` property.  In this example, the
https://www.h2database.com/javadoc/org/h2/jdbcx/JdbcDataSource.html#setUrl_String[`url`
Java Bean property] of the
https://www.h2database.com/javadoc/org/h2/jdbcx/JdbcDataSource.html[`org.h2.jdbcx.JdbcDataSource`
class] will be set to `jdbc:h2:mem:test`.  See the
https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP/blob/dev/README.md#initialization[HikariCP
documentation for more details].

=== Configure the Oracle Universal Connection Pool

If instead you have chosen to integrate the Oracle Universal
Connection Pool into your Helidon MP application, then ensure the
following YAML is present in your `application.yaml`, and that your
`application.yaml` is present on the runtime classpath of your Helidon
MP application:

[source,yaml]
----
javax:
  sql:
    DataSource: <1>
      test: <2>
        connectionFactoryClassName: org.h2.jdbcx.JdbcDataSource <3>
        URL: jdbc:h2:mem:test
        user: sa
        password: ""
----

<1> The YAML consisting of a top level `javax` mapping whose sole
element is a `sql` mapping whose sole mapping is a `DataSource`
mapping corresponds to the Java type of
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/sql/DataSource.html[`javax.sql.DataSource`].
This preamble specifies the type of Java object that will supply
database connections in your code.  Its sole element is a mapping
whose key is the name of the data source in question.  This preamble
is required.

<2> This mapping's key will be the name of your data source, and will
be referenced in your application code.  Each of its elements' keys
are
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/javabeans/writing/properties.html[Java
Bean properties] of the
https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/jjuar/oracle/ucp/jdbc/PoolDataSource.html[`oracle.ucp.jdbc.PoolDataSource`]
class.  By convention, data source names are usually single words
consisting of alphanumeric characters only.

<3> If your database vendor provides a
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/sql/DataSource.html[`DataSource`]
implementation class, then specify its name as the value of the
https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/jjuar/oracle/ucp/jdbc/PoolDataSource.html#setConnectionFactoryClassName_java_lang_String_[`connectionFactoryClassName`
Java Bean property].  In this example, which uses the
https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html[H2 database], the class name
in question is
https://www.h2database.com/javadoc/org/h2/jdbcx/JdbcDataSource.html[`org.h2.jdbcx.JdbcDataSource`].

== Inject a https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/sql/DataSource.html[`DataSource`] in Your Application Code

Now that you've included the relevant libraries and configured them
appropriately you can use the features they enable.

First, ensure your resource class imports `javax.sql.DataSource`:

[source,java]
----
import javax.sql.DataSource;
----

To inject the `test` data source configured in the examples above, add
a `DataSource` field annotated with both `@Inject` and `@Named("test")` as follows:

[source,java]
----
@Inject <1>
@Named("test") <2>
private DataSource testDataSource; <3>
----

<1> The
http://javax-inject.github.io/javax-inject/api/javax/inject/Inject.html[`@Inject`
annotation] is used to indicate that the CDI container should set the
annotated field automatically.

<2> The
http://javax-inject.github.io/javax-inject/api/javax/inject/Named.html[`@Named`
annotation] is used to select which of several potentially configured
data sources should be injected.  Here, the `test` data source is
requested.

<3> The `testDataSource` field, whose name is arbitrary, is typed with
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/sql/DataSource.html[`DataSource`].
Its protection level, `private` in this case, is immaterial, following
CDI rules.  Helidon MP's CDI container will use the configuration
described elsewhere in this document to create a new or retrieve an
existing `DataSource` implementation instance whose name is specified
by the `@Named` annotation, and will set this field's value to it.

== Examples

Helidon features a few examples of projects that use data sources.

* https://github.com/oracle/helidon/tree/{helidon-version}/examples/integrations/cdi/datasource-hikaricp-h2[An
  example showing a Hikari connection pool data source connected to an
  H2 database]

* https://github.com/oracle/helidon/tree/{helidon-version}/examples/integrations/cdi/datasource-hikaricp-mysql[An
  example showing a Hikari connection pool data source connected to a
  MySQL database]

Some examples' configurations can be found in their
`META-INF/microprofile-config.properties` resources instead of in an
`application.yaml` file as described above.  Though the syntax is
different, the same principles as those described above still apply.
