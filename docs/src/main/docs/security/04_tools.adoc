== Developer's Guide
This guide guides you through extension possibilities for Security component.

The component has the following extension points:

* Security providers
* Provider selection policy
* Integration with a framework

== Security providers
You can build a custom provider for each type of security concept supported.
By default, each provider is asynchronous. To simplify simple cases, a class
exists in "spi" package to help in implementing a synchronous approach:
 "SynchronousProvider".

You have two options:
1. Implement a provider interface and reference it in configuration (or from
 builder) by class
2. Implement a provider interface and provide a java service implementing
 "io.helidon.security.spi.SecurityProviderService"

The second option allows for easier configuration, as the configuration key can be
 used without a class definition and creates a default name of a provider.

=== Authentication provider
To create a custom authentication provider, create a class that implements
"io.helidon.security.spi.AuthenticationProvider".
Implementation is responsible for taking a request and assuming a subject
based on that request.
In case the protocol is multi-request (e.g. challenge for basic authentication),
 you have the possibility to return specific headers and a response code. The
 default semantics of these is HTTP, though providers may exist that are not
 HTTP specific.

=== Authorization provider
To create a custom authorization provider, create a class that implements
"io.helidon.security.spi.AuthorizationProvider".
Implementation is responsible for taking a request and checking whether the
 request can continue processing (e.g. if the current user and/or service subject
 has a right to execute it).

If authentication is configured, the Security component guarantees it resolved
 before authorization.

=== Outbound security provider
To create a custom outbound security provider, create a class that implements
"io.helidon.security.spi.OutboundSecurityProvider".
Implementation can update outgoing message headers to handle
security for an outgoing request (e.g. identity propagation, mapping etc.).

=== Audit provider
To create a custom audit provider, create a class that implements
"io.helidon.security.spi.AuditProvider".
Security component feeds each audit provider all messages from all components
that invoke audit method on "Security" class, including internal audit events
pre-configured in the component itself (e.g. authentication, authorization
 events).

Implementation may do whatever desired with these messages, e.g.:

* filter them
* log them
* store them to a database
* forward them to an audit component
* discard them

== Provider selection policy
Each request is processed by a single authentication and/or authorization
 provider. The selection policy provides the security component information about
 which provider to use. Out of the box, there are three policies:

1. "First" policy - first configured provider (or explicitly defined default
 provider) is used by default, if a named provider is requested, it would be used
2. "Composite" policy - this policy allows for a sequence of providers to be
 executed (e.g. one request may have more than one provider) - used for example to
 resolve service and user authentication
3. "Class" policy - this allows usage of a custom policy defined by fully
 qualified class name

To create a custom provider selection policy, create a class that implements
"io.helidon.security.spi.ProviderSelectionPolicy".

== Framework integration
To integrate a new framework, you should create a single Security
instance shared for a scope (e.g. one application). Security instance
has a method to create a SecurityContext (request scope).
Use tools of the framework integrated to add annotations support (if feasible).

There are two annotations that should be supported:

1. @Secured - to configure security, e.g. authentication, authorization
2. @Audited - to configure auditing

In addition you should implement integration of entity processing through Request
 builder - see integration for Jersey, class "SecurityFilter"
