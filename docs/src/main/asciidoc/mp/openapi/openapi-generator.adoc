The Helidon MP client generator creates a MicroProfile REST client interface for each API.
Each generated API interface is annotated so your code can `@Inject` the API into one of your own beans and then use the interface directly to invoke the remote service. Alternatively, you can also explicitly use the link:{microprofile-rest-client-javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/microprofile/rest/client/RestClientBuilder.html[`RestClientBuilder`] to create an instance programmatically and then invoke its methods to contact the remote service.
The xref:{restclient-page}[Helidon MP REST Client] documentation describes both approaches in more detail.

In the following example, `ExampleResource` (itself running in a server) invokes a remote Pet service and shows one way to use the generated `PetApi` REST client interface.

<1> Uses a bean-defining annotation so CDI can inject into this class.
<2> Requests that CDI inject the following field.
<3> Identifies to Helidon MP that the following field is a REST client.
<4> Declares the field using the generated `PetApi` type.
<5> Invokes the remote service using the injected field and the parameter from the incoming request.
