If you do not use the `helidon-microprofile-bundle` also add the following dependency which defines the MicroProfile OpenAPI annotations so you can use them in your code:
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.eclipse.microprofile.openapi</groupId>
    <artifactId>microprofile-openapi-api</artifactId>
</dependency>

== Usage

=== OpenAPI support in Helidon MP

You can very simply add support for OpenAPI to your Helidon MP application. This
document shows what changes you need to make to your application and how to access
the OpenAPI document for your application at runtime.

=== Changing your application

To use OpenAPI from your Helidon MP app, in addition to adding dependencies as described above:

1. Furnish OpenAPI information about your application's endpoints.
2. Update your application's configuration (optional).

include::{incdir}/openapi.adoc[tag=furnish-openapi-info]

=== Update your application configuration
Beyond the two config properties that denote the model reader and filter, Helidon
MP OpenAPI supports a number of other mandated settings. These are described in the
link:{microprofile-open-api-spec-url}#configuration[configuration section] of the MicroProfile
OpenAPI spec.

== API

include::{incdir}/openapi.adoc[tag=api]

== Configuration

Helidon OpenAPI configuration supports the following settings:

include::{rootdir}/config/io_helidon_openapi_OpenApiFeature.adoc[leveloffset=+1,tag=config]

Further, Helidon OpenAPI supports the MicroProfile OpenAPI settings described in link:{microprofile-open-api-spec-url}#_configuration[the MicroProfile OpenAPI specification].

== Examples

Helidon MP includes a link:{helidon-github-examples-url}/microprofile/openapi[complete OpenAPI example]
based on the MP quick-start sample app. The rest of this section shows, step-by-step, how one might change the original QuickStart service to adopt OpenAPI.

=== Helidon MP OpenAPI Example

This example shows a simple greeting application, similar to the one from the
Helidon MP QuickStart, enhanced with OpenAPI support.

[source,java]

<1> With `@Operation` annotation we document the current method.
<2> With `@RequestBody` annotation we document the content produced. Internal annotations `@Content`, `@Schema` and
 `@ExampleObjects` are used to give more details about the returned data.

If we want to hide a specific path an `OASFilter` is used.

The OASFilter interface allows application developers to receive callbacks for various key OpenAPI elements. The
 interface has a default implementation for every method, which allows application developers to only override the
 methods they care about. To use it, simply create an implementation of this interface and register it using the
 `mp.openapi.filter configuration` key, where the value is the fully qualified name of the filter class.

The following example filter prevents information about a given path from appearing in the OpenAPI document.

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/mp/openapi/OpenapiSnippets.java[tag=snippet_2, indent=0]
----

You can implement a model reader to provide all or part of the in-memory `OpenAPI` model programmatically. Helidon
 `OpenAPI` merges the model from the model reader with models from the other sources (a static file and annotations).

The example model reader below creates an `OpenAPI` object describing two paths. It turns out that the filter described
earlier will suppress one of the paths, but the model reader does not know or care.

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/mp/openapi/OpenapiSnippets.java[tag=snippet_3, indent=0]
----

Having written the filter and model reader classes, identify them by adding configuration to
 `META-INF/microprofile-config.properties` as the following example shows.

[source,properties]
----
mp.openapi.filter=io.helidon.microprofile.examples.openapi.internal.SimpleAPIFilter
mp.openapi.model.reader=io.helidon.microprofile.examples.openapi.internal.SimpleAPIModelReader
----


Now just build and run:

[source,bash]
----
mvn package
java -jar target/helidon-examples-microprofile-openapi.jar
----

Try the endpoints:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/greet
{"message":"Hello World!"}

curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/openapi
[lengthy OpenAPI document]
----

The output describes not only then endpoints from `GreetResource` but
also one contributed by the `SimpleAPIModelReader`.
