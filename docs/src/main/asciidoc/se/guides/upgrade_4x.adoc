= Helidon SE 4.x Upgrade Guide
:description: Helidon SE 4.x Upgrade Guide
:keywords: helidon, porting, migration, upgrade, incompatibilities
:rootdir: {docdir}/../..

include::{rootdir}/includes/attributes.adoc[]

In Helidon 4.x we have made some major changes to Helidon. Reactive engine has been removed.
APIS and implementations are rewritten in "blocking" paradigm.
This guide will help you upgrade a Helidon SE 3.x application to 4.x.


== Java 21 Runtime

Java 17 is no longer supported in Helidon 4. Java 21 or newer is required.
Please follow the instructions in xref:{rootdir}/about/prerequisites.adoc[Prerequisites] for proper installation.

Helidon 4 no longer uses Netty.
Helidon SE is now running on Helidon WebServer which is based on virtual threads technology, available in Java 21.


== Programming paradigm

Helidon SE has changed from an asynchronous style API to an imperative/blocking style API that is optimized for use with virtual threads.
Currently, there is no compatibility API available

== Server Initialization and Start Up

In Helidon 1.x-3.x you started a server like this:

[source,java]
.Start Helidon SE 3.x Server
----
include::{sourcedir}/se/guides/Upgrade4xSnippets.java[tag=snippet_1, indent=0]
----
<1> Server is started in an asynchronous way. A `Single` object is returned.
<2> Wait for the Server to start and print the message in an asynchronous way.
<3> Gracefully handle exceptions if they occur during the initialization process.

Since Helidon SE in 3.x was reactive, during the start a `Single` object is returned, the server has been started in asynchronous way.
We have to use reactive methods like `thenAccept` to wait for the server to start and then to perform the desired action.
The exception handling should also be done in reactive way using the corresponding method.

In Helidon 4.x asynchronous programming is no longer required so the server startup is much simpler:

[source,java]
.Start Helidon SE 4.x Server
----
include::{sourcedir}/se/guides/Upgrade4xSnippets.java[tag=snippet_2, indent=0]
----
<1> Configure the Server.
<2> Start the Server. No reactive objects returned.
<3> Print a message when the Server is started.

Just create it, configure it, and wait for it to start. If any exceptions happen, they are handled the traditional way using available language constructions.

== Server Features and Media Support Discovery

In previous versions of Helidon you had to explicitly register WebServer features (`register(MetricsSupport.create())`) and
explicitly add media support (`addMediaSupport(JsonpSupport.create())`). In Helidon 4 the default behavior is
to automatically discover these components from the classpath. So all you need to do is add the
dependencies to your pom.xml and optionally add configuration to customize them.

If you want full control using the API, you still have that option.

For more information see:

* xref:../observability.adoc[Observability feature support]
* xref:../webserver.adoc#_media_types_support[Media types support]

== Routing Configuration

In Helidon 1.x-3.x the routing config was done the following way:

[source,java]
.Routing in Helidon SE 3.x Server
----
include::{sourcedir}/se/guides/Upgrade4xSnippets.java[tag=snippet_3, indent=0]
----
<1> Create and configure `Metrics` and `Heath` support.
<2> Create a regular Helidon Service.
<3> Register `Metrics` and `Heath` support as Helidon Services.
<4> Register the regular Greeting service.

Services are created and assigned to the desired path. Observability and other features are being created as usual Helidon `services`, available as part of the framework. User-defined services are also registered the same way.

In Helidon 4, the routing is configured the following way:

[source,java]
.Start Helidon SE 4.x Server
----
include::{sourcedir}/se/guides/Upgrade4xSnippets.java[tag=snippet_4, indent=0]
----
<1> Register Greeting service as in previous versions of Helidon.

As described previously, the Metrics and Health features will be discovered automatically as long as you have
added the dependencies for them to your project.

If you wanted to add these features to the server programmatically you would do so using `WebServer.builder().addFeature()` method.

`Feature` encapsulates a set of endpoints, services and/or filters. It is similar to `HttpService` but gives more freedom in setup.
Main difference is that a feature can add `Filters` and it cannot be registered on a path.
Features are not registered immediatelyâ€”each feature can define a `Weight` or implement `Weighted` to order features according to their weight. Higher-weighted features are registered first.
This is to allow ordering of features in a meaningful way (e.g. Context should be first, Tracing second, Security third etc).


== Services

There are also significant changes in Helidon `Service`.

In prior versions, a service looks this way:

[source,java]
.Helidon SE 3.x Service
----
include::{sourcedir}/se/guides/Upgrade4xSnippets.java[tag=snippet_5, indent=0]
----
<1> Use `update()` method to set up routing.
<2> Handle a `Request` and return a `Responce`.

In Helidon 4, the same service:

[source,java]
.Helidon SE 4.x Service
----
include::{sourcedir}/se/guides/Upgrade4xSnippets.java[tag=snippet_6, indent=0]
----
<1> Implement `HttpService` for the `GreetingService`.
<2> Use `routing(HttpRules rules)` to set up routing.
<3> Handle a `Request` and return a `Responce`.

Helidon 4 introduced `HttpService` that should be implemented in order to process HTTP requests.
To set up routing, the method `routing(HttpRules rules)` should now be used.
It receives `HttpRules` object with routes description.

`ServerRequest` and `ServerResponse` are now in the `io.helidon.webserver.http` package;

`Http.Status` is now `io.helidon.http.Status`

WARNING: These changes make Helidon 4 incompatible with previous versions.

Learn more about `HttpService` and `Routing` at xref:../webserver.adoc[Helidon SE WebServer]

=== Other Significant Changes

==== Media Support

Media support has moved from the `io.helidon.media` Java package to `io.helidon.http.media` and has new dependency coordinates.
For example:

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.http.media</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-http-media-jsonp</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

In Helidon 4 media support is discovered by default, so you simply need to add the dependency.
You no longer need to explicitly add media support using the `WebServer` builder.

Media support no long transitively brings the Jakarta API dependencies. So you might need to add these explicitly. For example:

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>jakarta.json</groupId>
    <artifactId>jakarta.json-api</artifactId>
</dependency>
----


==== Testing

There is a new testing framework for Helidon SE.

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.microprofile.testing</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-microprofile-testing-junit5</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

Find more information, see xref:../introduction.adoc[Helidon SE testing]

==== Observability

Observability features of Helidon have now moved to different package. For `Health` and `Metrics` please use:

[source, xml]
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.helidon.webserver.observe</groupId>
        <artifactId>helidon-webserver-observe-health</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.helidon.webserver.observe</groupId>
        <artifactId>helidon-webserver-observe-metrics</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

Observability has new endpoints. See them xref:../observability.adoc[here].

For System Metrics, please use:

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.metrics</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-metrics-system-meters</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

By default, Observability features are discovered automatically if you add the above dependencies.
If you choose to add them programmatically (using `addFeature`) you will need to add the following dependency:

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.webserver.observe</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-webserver-observe</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Metrics has changed significantly in Helidon 4. See xref:../metrics/metrics.adoc[Helidon SE Metrics] for more information.

==== Security

* Changed modules:
- `helidon-security-integration-jersey` moved to the module `helidon-microprofile-security`
- `helidon-security-integration-jersey-client` moved to the module `helidon-microprofile-security`
- `helidon-security-integration-grpc` was removed
- `helidon-security-integration-webserver` moved to the module `helidon-webserver-security`

* Significant class name changes:
- `OidcSupport` renamed to `OidcFeature`
- `WebSecurity` renamed to `SecurityFeature`

* Other:
- `SynchronousProvider removed` - `SynchronousProvider` usage is no longer needed, since all security providers are synchronous.

=== Global Configuration

The global configuration represents a single instance of the `Config` class, which is implicitly employed by certain Helidon components. Furthermore, it offers a handy approach for your application to access configuration information from any part of your code.

It is recommended that you explicitly initialize global configuration before using any Helidon components:

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/se/guides/Upgrade4xSnippets.java[tag=snippet_7, indent=0]
----

You can then utilize the global configuration for easy retrieval of your application's configuration:

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/se/guides/Upgrade4xSnippets.java[tag=snippet_8, indent=0]
----

More information at xref:../config/introduction.adoc[Helidon SE Config].

=== Logging

The class `LogConfig` has moved to the `io.helidon.logging.common` Java package.

The Helidon console handler has changed from `io.helidon.common.HelidonConsoleHandler` to `io.helidon.logging.jul.HelidonConsoleHandler`.

If you use this handler in your `logging.properties` you will need to update it and add the following dependency:

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.logging</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-logging-jul</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
----
