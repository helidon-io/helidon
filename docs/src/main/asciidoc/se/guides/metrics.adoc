With these dependencies in your project, Helidon's auto-discovery of webserver features automatically finds and runs the metrics subsystem.
You do not need to change any of the generated source code.

Controlling Metrics section

For the SE guide, we stitch in the shared content about controlling metrics around SE-specific content that is not shared. It makes for a bit choppy-looking source here, but it renders just fine and lets us easily share the content that's common between SE and MP.

////
include::{rootdir}/includes/guides/metrics.adoc[tag=controlling-intro]

Your Helidon SE application can also control metrics processing programmatically as described in the following sections.

include::{rootdir}/includes/guides/metrics.adoc[tag=disabling-whole-intro]

A Helidon SE application can disable metrics processing programmatically.
[source,java]
.Disable all metrics behavior
----
include::{rootdir}/../java/io/helidon/docs/se/guides/MetricsSnippets.java[tag=snippet_1, indent=0]
----
<1> Begin preparing the `ObserveFeature`.
<2> Begin preparing the `MetricsObserver`.
<3> Disable metrics.
<4> Complete the `MetricsObserver`.
<5> Complete the `ObserveFeature`.
<6> Create and start the `WebServer` with the `ObserveFeature` (and other settings).

These builders and interfaces also have methods which accept `Config` objects representing the `metrics` node from the application configuration.

=== Application-Specific Metrics Data

This section demonstrates how to use application-specific {metrics} and integrate them with Helidon, starting from a Helidon SE QuickStart application.

It is the application's responsibility to create and update the {metrics} at runtime.  The application has
complete control over when and how each {metric} is used. For example, an application may use the
same counter for multiple methods, or one counter per method.  Helidon maintains a single meter registry which holds all {metrics}.

In all of these examples, the code uses a {metric} builder specific to the type of {metric} needed to register a new {metric} or locate a previous-registered {metric}.

==== Counter {metric_uc}

The `Counter` {metric} is a monotonically increasing number. The following example demonstrates how to use a `Counter` to track the number of times the `/cards` endpoint is called.

[source,java]
.Create a new class named `GreetingCards` with the following code:
----
include::{sourcedir}/se/guides/MetricsSnippets.java[tag=snippet_3, indent=0]
----
<1> Declare a `Counter` member field.
<2> Create and register the `Counter` {metric} in the global meter registry`.  This `Counter` will exist for the lifetime of
the application.
<3> Increment the count.

[source,java]
.Update the `routing` method in the main class as follows:
----
include::{sourcedir}/se/guides/MetricsSnippets.java[tag=snippet_4, indent=0]
----
<1> Add the `GreetingCards` service to the routing.  Helidon routes any REST requests with
the `/cards` root path to the `GreetingCards` service.

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
.Build and run the application, then invoke the endpoints below:
----
curl http://localhost:8080/cards
curl -H "Accept: application/json" 'http://localhost:8080{metrics-endpoint}?scope=application'
----

[source,hocon]
.JSON response:
----
{
  "cardCount": 1 // <1>
}
----
<1> The count value is one since the method was called once.


==== Timer {metric_uc}

The `Timer` {metric} aggregates durations.

In the following example,
a `Timer` {metric} measures the duration of a method's execution.  Whenever the REST `/cards`
endpoint is called, the code updates the `Timer` with additional timing information.

[source,java]
.Replace the `GreetingCards` class with the following code:
----
include::{sourcedir}/se/guides/MetricsSnippets.java[tag=snippet_5, indent=0]
----
<1> Declare a `Timer` member field.
<2> Create and register the `Timer` metric in the global meter registry.
<3> Create a timer sample which, among other things, automatically records the starting time.
<4> Arrange for the timer sample to be stopped and applied to the `cardTimer` once Helidon sends the response to the client.


[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
.Build and run the application, then invoke the endpoints below:
----
curl http://localhost:8080/cards
curl http://localhost:8080/cards
curl -H "Accept: application/json"  'http://localhost:8080{metrics-endpoint}?scope=application'
----


[source,json]
.JSON response:
----
{
  "cardTimer": {
    "count": 2,
    "max": 0.01439681,
    "mean": 0.0073397075,
    "elapsedTime": 0.014679415,
    "p0.5": 0.000278528,
    "p0.75": 0.01466368,
    "p0.95": 0.01466368,
    "p0.98": 0.01466368,
    "p0.99": 0.01466368,
    "p0.999": 0.01466368
  }
}
----
Helidon updated the timer statistics for each of the two accesses to the `/cards` endpoint.


==== Distribution Summary {metrics_uc}

The `DistributionSummary` {metric} calculates the distribution of a set of values within ranges.  This {metric} does
not relate to time at all.  The following example records a set of random numbers in a `DistributionSummary` {metric} when
the `/cards` endpoint is invoked.

[source,java]
.Replace the `GreetingCards` class with the following code:
----
include::{sourcedir}/se/guides/MetricsSnippets.java[tag=snippet_6, indent=0]
----
<1> Declare a `DistributionSummary` member field.
<2> Create and register the `DistributionSummary` {metric} in the global meter registry
<3> Update the distribution summary with a random number multiple times for each request.


[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
.Build and run the application, then invoke the endpoints below:
----
curl http://localhost:8080/cards
curl -H "Accept: application/json"  'http://localhost:8080{metrics-endpoint}?scope=application'
----


[source,json]
.JSON response:
----
{
  "cardDist": {
    "count": 1000,
    "max": 1.999805150914427,
    "mean": 1.4971440362723523,
    "total": 1497.1440362723522,
    "p0.5": 1.4375,
    "p0.75": 1.6875,
    "p0.95": 1.9375,
    "p0.98": 1.9375,
    "p0.99": 1.9375,
    "p0.999": 1.9375
  }
}
----
The `DistributionSummary.Builder` allows your code to configure other aspects of the summary, such as bucket boundaries and percentiles to track.

==== Gauge Metric

The `Gauge` {metric} measures a value that is maintained by code outside the metrics subsystem. As with other {metrics}, the application explicitly registers a gauge. When the `{metrics-endpoint}` endpoint
is invoked, Helidon retrieves the value of each registered `Gauge`.  The following example demonstrates
how a `Gauge` is used to get the current temperature.

[source,java]
.Replace the `GreetingCards` class with the following code:
----
include::{sourcedir}/se/guides/MetricsSnippets.java[tag=snippet_7, indent=0]
----
<1> Register the `Gauge`, passing a `Supplier<Double>` which furnishes a random temperature from 0 to 100.0 each time the metrics system interrogates the gauge.


[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
.Build and run the application, then invoke the endpoint below:
----
curl -H "Accept: application/json"  'http://localhost:8080{metrics-endpoint}?scope=application
----

[source,hocon]
.JSON response:
----
{
  "temperature": 46.582132737739066 // <1>
}
----
<1> The current (random) temperature. Accessing the endpoint again returns a different value.

{metrics} and scopes.

* Access {metrics} for all three built-in scopes: base, vendor, and application
* Configure {metrics} that are updated by the application when an application REST endpoint is invoked
* Configure a `Gauge` {metric}
* Integrate Helidon metrics with Kubernetes and Prometheus
