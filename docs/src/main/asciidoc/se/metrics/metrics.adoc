== Overview
Helidon SE metrics is a neutral metrics API which provides
include::{rootdir}/includes/metrics/metrics-shared.adoc[tag=overview]

=== A Word about Terminology
Helidon {flavor-uc} uses the term "metrics" to refer to the subsystem in Helidon which manages the registration of, updates to,
 and reporting of aggregate statistical measurements about the service.
The term "{meter}" refers to an entity which collects these measurements, such as a counter or a timer.

// Maven coordinates comes next
include::{rootdir}/includes/dependencies.adoc[]

.Packaging the metrics API
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.metrics</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-metrics-api</artifactId>
</dependency>
----
This dependency adds the metrics API and a no-op implementation of that API to your project.
The no-op implementation:

* does not register {metrics} in a registry
* does not update {metric} values
* does not expose the metrics endpoint for reporting {metric} values.

To include the full-featured metrics implementation, add the following dependency to your project:

.Packaging a full-featured metrics implementation
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.webserver.observe</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-webserver-observe-metrics</artifactId>
</dependency>
----
Adding this dependency packages the full-featured metrics implementation and support for the metrics endpoint with your service.

You might notice the transitive dependency `io.helidon.metrics.providers:helidon-metrics-providers-micrometer` in your project.
This component contains an implementation of the Helidon metrics API that uses Micrometer as the underlying metrics technology.

Helidon provides several built-in {meters} in a separate artifact.
To include the build-in {meters}, add the following dependency to your project:

.Packaging the built-in {meters}
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.metrics</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-metrics-system-meters</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
----

== Usage

include::{rootdir}/includes/metrics/metrics-shared.adoc[tag=usage-body]

=== Meter Registry
Helidon stores all meters in a _meter registry_. Typically, applications use the global meter registry which is the registry where Helidon stores built-in meters.
Application code refers to the global registry using `Metrics.globalRegistry()`.


include::{rootdir}/includes/metrics/metrics-shared.adoc[tag=usage-retrieving]


===  Enabling the Metrics REST Service
If you add the dependencies described above, your service automatically supports the metrics REST endpoint as long as the `WebServer` is configured to discover features automatically.

If you disable auto-discovery, you can add the metrics observer explicitly.

. Create an instance of `MetricsObserver`, either directly as shown below or using its builder.
. Include the `MetricsObserver` instance in your application's `ObserveFeature`.
. Register your `ObserveFeature` with your `WebServer`.

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/se/metrics/MetricsSnippets.java[tag=snippet_1, indent=0]
----


== API
To work with Helidon Metrics in your code, follow these steps:

. Use the static `globalRegistry` method on the link:{metrics-javadoc-base-url}/io/helidon/metrics/api/Metrics.html[`Metrics`] interface to get a reference to the global  link:{metrics-javadoc-base-url}/io/helidon/metrics/api/MeterRegistry.html[`MeterRegistry`] instance.
. Use the `MeterRegistry` instance to register new {metrics} and look up previously-registered {metrics}.
. Use the {metric} reference returned from the `MeterRegistry` to update the {metric} or get its value.

You can also use the `MeterRegistry` to remove an existing {metric}.

=== Helidon Metrics API

The Helidon Metrics API defines the classes and interfaces for {metric} types and other related items.

The following table summarizes the {metric} types.

.{Metric_uc} Types
[%autowidth]
|====
| {Metric_uc} Type | Usage

| link:{metrics-javadoc-base-url}/io/helidon/metrics/api/Counter.html[`Counter`]
| Monotonically increasing count of events.

| link:{metrics-javadoc-base-url}/io/helidon/metrics/api/Gauge.html[`Gauge`]
| Access to a value managed by other code in the service.

|link:{metrics-javadoc-base-url}/io/helidon/metrics/api/DistributionSummary.html[`DistributionSummary`]
|Calculates the distribution of a value.


| link:{metrics-javadoc-base-url}/io/helidon/metrics/api/Timer.html[`Timer`]
| Frequency of invocations and the distribution of how long the invocations take.

|====

Each {metric} type has its own set of methods for updating and retrieving the value.

=== The `MeterRegistry` API
To register or look up {meters} programmatically, your service code uses the global `MeterRegistry`.
Simply invoke `Metrics.globalRegistry()` to get a reference to the global meter registry.

To locate an existing meter or register a new one, your code:

. Creates a builder of the appropriate type of meter, setting the name and possibly other characteristics of the meter.
. Invokes the `MeterRegistry.getOrCreate` method, passing the builder.

The meter registry returns a reference to a previously-registered meter with the specified name and tags or, if none exists, a newly-registered meter.
Your code can then operate on the returned meter as needed to record new measurements or retrieve existing data.

The example code in the <<Examples>> section below illustrates how to register, retrieve, and update meters.

=== Accessing the Underlying Implementation: `unwrap`
The neutral Helidon metrics API is an abstraction of common metrics behavior independent from any given implementation. As such, we intentionally excluded some implementation-specific behavior from the API.

Sometimes you might want access to methods that are present in a particular metrics implementation but not in the Helidon API. Helidon allows that via the `unwrap` method on the meter types and on their builders. Each full implementation of the Helidon meter types and their builders refers to a delegate meter or delegate builder internally. The `unwrap` method lets you obtain the delegate, cast to the type you want.

Of course, using this technique binds your code to a particular metrics implementation.

The link:{metrics-javadoc-base-url}/io/helidon/metrics/api/Wrapper.html[`Wrapper`] interface declares the `unwrap` method which accepts a class parameter to which the delegate is cast. You can then invoke any method declared on the implementation-specific type.

== Examples

include::{rootdir}/includes/metrics/metrics-shared.adoc[tag=example-apps]

The rest of this section shows how to add a custom meter to your code and how to configure the Helidon metrics subsystem.

=== Example Application Code

The following example, based on the Helidon SE QuickStart application, shows how to register and update a new `Counter` in application code.
 The counter tracks the number of times any of the service endpoints is accessed.

.Define and use a `Counter`
[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/se/metrics/MetricsSnippets.java[tag=snippet_2, indent=0]
----
<1> Get the global meter registry.
<2> Create (or find) a counter named "accessctr" in the global registry.
<3> Route every request to the `countAccess` method.
<4> Increment the access counter for every request.

Perform the following steps to see the new counter in action.

.Build and run the application
[source,bash]
----
mvn package
java -jar target/helidon-quickstart-se.jar
----

.Retrieve `application` metrics
[source, bash]
----
curl 'http://localhost:8080/observe/metrics?scope=application' # <1>
----

[source,text]
.Response
----
# HELP accessctr_total
# TYPE accessctr_total counter
accessctr_total{scope="application",} 0.0 # <2>
----
<1> Access the metrics endpoint, selecting only application meters.
<2> Note the counter is zero; we have not accessed a service endpoint yet.

.Access a service endpoint to retrieve a greeting
[source,bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/greet
----

[source,json]
.JSON response:
----
{"message":"Hello World"}
----

.Retrieve `application` metrics again
[source,bash]
----
curl 'http://localhost:8080/observe/metrics?scope=application'
----

[source,text]
.Response
----
# HELP accessctr_total
# TYPE accessctr_total counter
accessctr_total{scope="application",} 1.0 # <1>
----
<1> The counter now reports 1, reflecting our earlier access to the `/greet` endpoint.

== Additional Information

=== Support for the Prometheus Metrics API
- <<Maven Coordinates, Maven Coordinates>>
- <<Usage, Usage>>
- <<API, API>>

Helidon provides optional support for the Prometheus metrics API.

To use it, your service registers Prometheus support with your routing set-up.
You can customize its configuration. For information about using Prometheus, see the
Prometheus documentation: https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/.

NOTE: Helidon's fully-functional, built-in metrics implementation supports Prometheus (OpenMetrics) output.
 Use the optional support described in _this_ section only if you want to use the Prometheus _API_ from your application code.

----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.metrics</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-metrics-prometheus</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

[[prom-usage]]
==== Usage
Your application code uses the Prometheus API to manage metrics.
To expose those metrics to clients via a REST endpoint, your code uses the `PrometheusSupport` interface which Helidon provides.

[[prom-api]]
==== API
Your code creates a link:{prometheus-javadoc-base-url}/io/helidon/metrics/prometheus/PrometheusSupport.html[`PrometheusSupport`] object either using a static factory method (shown in the following example) or by using its link:{prometheus-javadoc-base-url}/io/helidon/metrics/prometheus/PrometheusSupport.Builder.html[`Builder`].

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/se/metrics/MetricsSnippets.java[tag=snippet_3, indent=0]
----

This example uses the default Prometheus `CollectorRegistry`. By default, the `PrometheusSupport` and exposes its REST endpoint at the path
`/metrics`. Use the builder obtained by `PrometheusSupport.builder()` to
configure a different `CollectorRegistry` or a different path.
