== Overview

The Helidon GraphQL Server provides a framework for creating link:https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java[GraphQL]
applications that integrate with the Helidon WebServer. GraphQL is a query language to access server data.
The Helidon GraphQL integration enables HTTP clients to issue queries over the network and retrieve data;
it is an alternative to other protocols such as REST or GRPC.

== API

An instance of `GraphQlSupport` must be registered in the Helidon WebServer routes to enable
GraphQL support in your application. In addition, a GraphQL schema needs to be specified
to verify and execute queries.

The following code fragment creates an instance of `GraphQlSupport` and registers it in the
Helidon WebServer.

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/se/GraphQlSnippets.java[tag=snippet_1, indent=0]
----

By default, `GraphQlSupport` will reserve  `/graphql` as the URI path to process queries.
The `buildSchema` method creates the schema and defines 2 types of queries for this
application:

----

The following is a description of each of these steps:

<1> Define the GraphQL schema.
<2> Create a `DataFetcher` to return a list of hellos in different languages.
<3> Wire up the `DataFetcher` s.
<4> Generate the GraphQL schema.

== Configuration

include::{rootdir}/includes/graphql.adoc[]

== Examples

Using the schema defined in Section <<API>>, you can probe the following endpoints:

1. Hello world endpoint
+
[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:PORT/graphql -d '{"query":"query { hello }"}'

"data":{"hello":"world"}}
----

2. Hello in different languages
+
[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:PORT/graphql -d '{"query":"query { helloInDifferentLanguages }"}'

{"data":{"helloInDifferentLanguages":["Bonjour","Hola","Zdravstvuyte","Nǐn hǎo","Salve","Gudday","Konnichiwa","Guten Tag"]}}
