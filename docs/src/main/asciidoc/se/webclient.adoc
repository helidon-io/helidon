== Overview

WebClient is an HTTP client for Helidon SE. It can be used to send requests and retrieve corresponding responses in a programmatic way.

Helidon WebClient provides the following features:

* *Blocking approach* +
The Webclient uses the blocking approach to synchronously process a request and its correspond response. Both `HTTP/1.1` and `HTTP/2` request and response will run in the thread of the user. Additionally, for `HTTP/2`, virtual thread is employed to manage the connection.

* *Builder-like setup and execution* +
Creates every client and request as a builder pattern. This improves readability and code maintenance.

* *Redirect chain* +
Follows the redirect chain and perform requests on the correct endpoint by itself.

* *Tracing and security propagation* +
Automatically propagates the configured tracing and security settings of the Helidon WebServer to the WebClient and uses them during request and response.

<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.webclient</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-webclient</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

The `helidon-webclient` dependency has built-in support for `HTTP/1.1`.

If support for `HTTP/2` is a requirement, below dependency needs to be added:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.webclient</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-webclient-http2</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

== Usage

=== Instantiating the WebClient

You can create an instance of a WebClient by executing `WebClient.create()` which will have default settings and without a base uri set.

To change the default settings and register
additional services, you can use simple builder that allows you to customize the client behavior.

.Create a WebClient with simple builder:
[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/se/WebClientSnippets.java[tag=snippet_1, indent=0]
----

=== Creating the Request

WebClient offers a set of request methods that are used to specify the type of action to be performed on a given resource. Below are some examples of request methods:

* `get()`
* `post()`
* `put()`
* `method(String methodName)`

Check out link:{webclient-javadoc-base-url}.api/io/helidon/webclient/api/HttpClient.html[HttpClient] API to learn more about
request methods. These methods will create a new instance of link:{webclient-javadoc-base-url}.api/io/helidon/webclient/api/HttpClientRequest.html[HttpClientRequest] which can then be configured to add optional settings that will customize the behavior of the request.

=== Customizing the Request

Configuration can be set for every request type before it is sent.

.Customizing a request
[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/se/WebClientSnippets.java[tag=snippet_12, indent=0]
----

<1> Overrides `baseUri` from WebClient
<2> Adds path to the uri
<3> Adds query parameter to the request
<4> Adds fragment to the request
<5> Adds header to the request

For more information about these optional parameters, check out link:{webclient-javadoc-base-url}.api/io/helidon/webclient/api/ClientRequestBase.html[ClientRequestBase] API, which is a parent class of link:{webclient-javadoc-base-url}.api/io/helidon/webclient/api/HttpClientRequest.html[HttpClientRequest].

link:{webclient-javadoc-base-url}.api/io/helidon/webclient/api/HttpClientRequest.html[HttpClientRequest] class also provides specific header methods that help the user to set a particular header. Some examples of these are:

* `contentType` (MediaType contentType)
* `accept` (MediaType... mediaTypes)

For more information about these methods, check out  link:{webclient-javadoc-base-url}.api/io/helidon/webclient/api/ClientRequest.html[ClientRequest] API, which is a parent class of link:{webclient-javadoc-base-url}.api/io/helidon/webclient/api/HttpClientRequest.html[HttpClientRequest].

=== Sending the Request

Once the request setup is completed, the following methods can be used to send it:

* `HttpClientResponse request()`
* `<E> ClientResponseTyped<E> request(Class<E> type)`
* `<E> E requestEntity(Class<E> type)`
* `HttpClientResponse submit(Object entity)`
* `<T> ClientResponseTyped<T> submit(Object entity, Class<T> requestedType)`
* `HttpClientResponse outputStream(OutputStreamHandler outputStreamConsumer)`
* `<T> ClientResponseTyped<T> outputStream(OutputStreamHandler outputStreamConsumer, Class<T> requestedType)`

Each of the methods will provide a way to allow response to be retrieved in a particular response type. Refer to link:{webclient-javadoc-base-url}.api/io/helidon/webclient/api/ClientRequest.html[ClientRequest API] for more details about these methods.

.Execute a simple GET request to endpoint and receive a String response:
[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/se/WebClientSnippets.java[tag=snippet_2, indent=0]
----

=== Protocol Used
WebClient currently supports `HTTP/1.1` and `HTTP/2` protocols. Below are the rules on which specific protocol will be used:

* Using plain socket triggers WebClient to process a request using `HTTP/1.1`.
* When using TLS, the client will use ALPN (protocol negotiation) to use appropriate HTTP version (either 1.1, or 2). `HTTP/2` has a higher weight, so it is chosen if supported by both sides.
* A specific protocol can be explicitly selected by calling `HttpClientRequest#protocolId(String)`.
[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/se/WebClientSnippets.java[tag=snippet_3, indent=0]
----
* If `HTTP/2` is used, an upgrade attempt will be performed. If it fails, the client falls-back to `HTTP/1.1`.
* The parameter `prior-knowledge` can be defined using `HTTP/2` protocol configuration. Please refer to <<Setting Protocol configuration>> on how to customize `HTTP/2`. In such a case, `prior-knowledge` will be used and fail if it is unable to switch to `HTTP/2`.

=== Adding Media Support

Webclient supports the following built-in Helidon Media Support libraries:

1. JSON Processing (JSON-P)
2. JSON Binding (JSON-B)
3. Jackson

They can be activated by adding their corresponding libraries into the classpath. This can simply be done by adding their corresponding dependencies.

.Add JSON-P support:
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.http.media</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-http-media-jsonp</artifactId>
</dependency>
----
.Add JSON-B support:
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.http.media</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-http-media-jsonb</artifactId>
</dependency>
----
.Add Jackson support:
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.http.media</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-http-media-jackson</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Users can also create their own Custom Media Support library and make them work by following either of the approaches:

* Create a Provider of the Custom Media Support and expose it via Service Loader followed by adding the Media Support library to the classpath.
* Explicitly register the Custom Media Support from WebClient.

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/se/WebClientSnippets.java[tag=snippet_4, indent=0]
----
<1> Register CustomMedia support from the WebClient.

=== DNS Resolving

Webclient provides three DNS resolver implementations out of the box:

* `Java DNS resolution` is the default.
* `*First* DNS resolution` uses the first IP address from a DNS lookup. To enable this option, add below dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.webclient.dns.resolver</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-webclient-dns-resolver-first</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

* `*Round-Robin* DNS resolution` cycles through IP addresses from a DNS lookup. To enable this option, add this dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.webclient.dns.resolver</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-webclient-dns-resolver-round-robin</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

== Configuring the WebClient

The class responsible for WebClient configuration is:

include::{rootdir}/config/io_helidon_webclient_api_WebClient.adoc[leveloffset=+1,tag=config]

=== Protocol Specific Configuration

Protocol specific configuration can be set using the  `protocol-configs` parameter. Webclient currently supports `HTTP/1.1.` and `HTTP/2`. Below are the options for each of the protocol type:

* `HTTP/1.1`

include::{rootdir}/config/io_helidon_webclient_http1_Http1ClientProtocolConfig.adoc[leveloffset=2,tag=config]


* `HTTP/2`

include::{rootdir}/config/io_helidon_webclient_http2_Http2ClientProtocolConfig.adoc[leveloffset=2,tag=config]

== Examples

=== Webclient with Proxy
Configure Proxy setup either programmatically or via the Helidon configuration framework.

==== Configuring Proxy in your code
Proxy can be set directly from WebClient builder.
[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/se/WebClientSnippets.java[tag=snippet_6, indent=0]
----

Alternative is to set proxy directly from the request via  `HttpClientRequest`.

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/se/WebClientSnippets.java[tag=snippet_7,indent=0]
----

<1> Proxy instance configured using system settings (environment variables and system properties)
<2> Configure the proxy per client request

==== Configuring Proxy in the config file

Proxy can also be configured in WebClient through the `application.yaml` configuration file.

[source,yaml]
.WebClient Proxy configuration in `application.yaml`
----
client:
  proxy:
    host: "hostName"
    port: 80
    no-proxy: ["localhost:8080", ".helidon.io", "192.168.1.1"]
----
Then, in your application code, load the configuration from that file.

[source,java]
.WebClient initialization using the `application.yaml` file located on the classpath
----
include::{sourcedir}/se/WebClientSnippets.java[tag=snippet_8,indent=0]
----
<1> `application.yaml` is a default configuration source loaded when YAML support is on classpath, so we can just use `Config.create()`
<2> Passing the client configuration node

=== WebClient TLS Setup

Configure TLS either programmatically or by the Helidon configuration framework.

==== Configuring TLS in your code

One way to configure TLS in WebClient is in your application code as shown below.

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/se/WebClientSnippets.java[tag=snippet_9,indent=0]
----

==== Configuring TLS in the config file

Another way to configure TLS in WebClient is through the `application.yaml` configuration file.

[source,yaml]
.WebClient TLS configuration in `application.yaml`
----
client:
  tls:
    trust:
      keystore:
        passphrase: "password"
        trust-store: true
        resource:
          resource-path: "client.p12"
----

NOTE: The `passphrase` value on the config file can be encrypted if stronger security is required. For more information on how secrets can be encrypted using a master password and store them in a configuration file, please see xref:{rootdir}/mp/security/configuration-secrets.adoc[Configuration Secrets].

In the application code, load the settings from the configuration file.

[source,java]

----
<1> `application.yaml` is a default configuration source loaded when YAML support is on classpath, so we can just use `Config.create()`
<2> Passing the client configuration node

=== Adding Service to WebClient

WebClient currently supports 3 built-in services namely `metrics`, `tracing` and `security`.

==== Enabling the service

In order for a service to function, their dependency needs to be added in the application's pom.xml. Below are examples on how to enable the built-in services:

* `metrics`
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.webclient</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-webclient-metrics</artifactId>
</dependency>
----
* `tracing`
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.webclient</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-webclient-tracing</artifactId>
</dependency>
----
* `security`
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.webclient</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-webclient-security</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

==== Adding a service in your code

Services can be added in WebClient as shown in the code below.

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/se/WebClientSnippets.java[tag=snippet_10,indent=0]
----
<1> Creates new metric which will count all GET requests and has format of `example.metric.GET.<host-name>`
<2> Register the service in the client instance

==== Adding service in the config file

Adding service in WebClient can also be done through the `application.yaml` configuration file.

[source,yaml]
.WebClient Service configuration in `application.yaml`
----
webclient:
  services:
    metrics:
      - type: METER
        name-format: "client.meter.overall"
      - type: TIMER
        # meter per method
        name-format: "client.meter.%1$s"
      - methods: ["PUT", "POST", "DELETE"]
        type: COUNTER
        success: false
        name-format: "wc.counter.%1$s.error"
        description: "Counter of failed PUT, POST and DELETE requests"
    tracing:
----
Then, in your application code, load the configuration from that file.

[source,java]
.WebClient initialization using the `application.yaml` file located on the classpath
----
include::{sourcedir}/se/WebClientSnippets.java[tag=snippet_8,indent=0]
----

<1> `application.yaml` is a default configuration source loaded when YAML support is on classpath, so we can just use `Config.create()`
<2> Passing the client configuration node

=== Setting Protocol configuration
Individual protocols can be customized using the `protocol-config` parameter.

==== Setting up protocol configuration in your code

Below is an example of customizing `HTTP/1.1` protocol in the application code.

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/se/WebClientSnippets.java[tag=snippet_11,indent=0]
----

==== Setting up protocol configuration in the config file

Protocol configuration can also be set in the `application.yaml` configuration file.
