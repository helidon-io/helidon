== Overview

Asynchronous messaging is a commonly used form of communication in the world of microservices.
While it is possible to start building your reactive streams directly by combining operators and
connecting them to reactive APIs, with Helidon SE Reactive Messaging, you can now use prepared
tools for repetitive use case scenarios .

== Usage

Connecting your streams to external services usually requires a lot of boilerplate
code for configuration handling, backpressure propagation, acknowledgement and more.

In Helidon there is a system of connectors, emitters and means to orchestrate these tasks
called *Reactive Messaging*. It's basically an API for connecting and configuring
connectors and emitters with your reactive streams through <<Channel,Channels>>.

Reactive Messaging relates to
xref:../mp/reactivemessaging/introduction.adoc[MicroProfile Reactive Messaging] as the making of connectors and configuring them can be a repetitive task that ultimately leads to
the same results. Helidon SE Reactive Messaging supports the very same configuration format
for connectors as its MicroProfile counterpart does. Also, MP Connectors are reusable in
Helidon SE Messaging with some limitations such as there is no CDI in Helidon SE.
All <<Messaging Connector,Messaging connectors>> in Helidon are made to be universally usable by Helidon MP and SE.

=== Channel

A channel is a named pair of `Publisher` and `Subscriber`. Channels can be connected together by
<<Processor,processors>>. Registering a `Publisher` or `Subscriber` for a channel can be done
by Messaging API, or configured implicitly using registered <<Connectors,connectors>>
to generate the `Publisher` or `Subscriber`.

[source,java]
.Example of simple channel:
----
include::{sourcedir}/se/ReactiveMessagingSnippets.java[tag=snippet_1, indent=0]
----

=== Processor

Processor is a typical reactive processor acting as a `Subscriber` to upstream and as a `Publisher`
to downstream. In terms of reactive messaging, it is able to connect two <<Channel,channels>> to one
reactive stream.

[source,java]
.Example of processor usage:
----
include::{sourcedir}/se/ReactiveMessagingSnippets.java[tag=snippet_2, indent=0]
----

=== Message

Reactive Messaging in Helidon SE uses the same concept of
message wrapping as MicroProfile messaging.
The only notable difference is that SE Messaging does almost no implicit or automatic
acknowledgement due to _no magic_ philosophy of Helidon SE.

The only exception to this are the variants of the methods `Messaging.Builder#listener` and
`Messaging.Builder#processor` configured with consumer or function parameters which will  conveniently unwrap the payload
for you. Once the payload is automatically unwrapped, it is not possible to do a manual acknowledgement, therefore
an implicit acknowledgement is executed before the callback.

=== Connectors

Connectors are used to connect <<Channel,channels>> to external sources.
To make the <<Messaging Connector,creation and usage of connectors>>
as easy and versatile as possible, Helidon SE Messaging uses the same API for connectors
that xref:../mp/reactivemessaging/introduction.adoc[MicroProfile Reactive Messaging] does.
This allows connectors to be used in both flavors of Helidon with one limitation which is
that the connector has to be able to work without CDI.

Examples of versatile connectors in Helidon include the following:

* <<Kafka Connector,Kafka connector>>
* <<JMS Connector,JMS connector>>
* <<AQ Connector,AQ Connector>>

==== Messaging Connector

A connector for Reactive Messaging is a factory that produces Publishers and Subscribers for
Channels in Reactive Messaging. Messaging connector is just an implementation of
`IncomingConnectorFactory`, `OutgoingConnectorFactory` or both.

[source,java]
.Example connector `example-connector`:
----
include::{sourcedir}/se/ReactiveMessagingSnippets.java[tag=snippet_3, indent=0]
----

[source,yaml]
.Example of channel to connector mapping config:
----
mp.messaging.outgoing.to-connector-channel.connector: example-connector
mp.messaging.incoming.from-connector-channel.connector: example-connector
----

[source,java]
.Example producing to connector:

===== Configuration for Messaging Connector

A messaging connector in Helidon SE can be configured explicitly by API or implicitly
by config following the notation of link:https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-reactive-messaging-1.0/microprofile-reactive-messaging-spec.html#_configuration[MicroProfile Reactive Messaging].

Configuration that is supplied to connector by the Messaging implementation must include
two mandatory attributes:

* `channel-name` which is the name of the channel that has the connector configured as Publisher or Subscriber, or `Channel.create('name-of-channel')` in case of explicit configuration or `mp.messaging.incoming.name-of-channel.connector: connector-name` in case of implicit config
* `connector` name of the connector `@Connector("connector-name")`

[source,java]
.Example connector accessing configuration:
----
include::{sourcedir}/se/ReactiveMessagingSnippets.java[tag=snippet_6, indent=0]
----
<1> Config context is merged from channel and connector contexts

====== Explicit Config for Messaging Connector

An explicit config for channel's publisher is possible with `Channel.Builder#publisherConfig(Config config)`
and for a subscriber with the `Channel.Builder#subscriberConfig(Config config)`.
The supplied xref:config/introduction.adoc[Helidon Config] is merged with
the mandatory attributes and any implicit configuration found. The resulting configuration is then served to the Connector.

[source,java]
.Example consuming from Kafka connector with explicit config:
----
include::{sourcedir}/se/ReactiveMessagingSnippets.java[tag=snippet_7, indent=0]
----
<1> Prepare channel for connecting kafka connector with specific publisher configuration -> listener,
<2> Channel -> connector mapping is automatic when using `KafkaConnector.configBuilder()`
<3> Prepare Kafka connector, can be used by any channel

====== Implicit Config for Messaging Connector

Implicit config without any hard-coding is possible with xref:config/introduction.adoc[Helidon Config] following notation of link:https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-reactive-messaging-1.0/microprofile-reactive-messaging-spec.html#_configuration[MicroProfile Reactive Messaging].

[source,yaml]
.Example of channel to connector mapping config with custom properties:
----
mp.messaging.incoming.from-connector-channel.connector: example-connector<1>
mp.messaging.incoming.from-connector-channel.first-test-prop: foo<2>
mp.messaging.connector.example-connector.second-test-prop: bar<3>
----
<1> Channel -> Connector mapping
<2> Channel configuration properties
<3> Connector configuration properties

[source,java]
.Example consuming from connector:
----
include::{sourcedir}/se/ReactiveMessagingSnippets.java[tag=snippet_8, indent=0]
----

==== Re-usability in MP Messaging

As the API is the same for xref:../mp/reactivemessaging/introduction.adoc[MicroProfile Reactive Messaging]
connectors, all that is needed to make connector work in both ways is annotating it with
`@ApplicationScoped`. Such connector is treated as a bean in Helidon MP.
