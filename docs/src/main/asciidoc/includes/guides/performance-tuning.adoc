== WebServer Tuning

Helidon WebServer is in large part self tuning. It uses default values that will satisfy most use cases,
and with the adoption of Java virtual threads there is no longer a need to tune pools of platform threads.
Still, there might be cases where you wish to change configuration options from their default values.

For details on the following options please see:

* xref:../../se/webserver.adoc#_configuration_options[WebServer Configuration]
* xref:../../config/io_helidon_webserver_ConnectionConfig.adoc[WebServer Connection Configuration]
* xref:../../config/io_helidon_common_socket_SocketOptions.adoc[WebServer Socket Configuration]

== Summary of Tuning Options

The following `application.yaml` snippet shows some configuration options that can be used to
tune your application. It is intended to show configuration options in context. Please make sure
you understand these options before using them. See the documentation referenced above.

server:
  # These are used to prevent unbounded resource consumption of the server
  idle-connection-period: PT2M  # Check idle connections every 2 minutes
  idle-connection-timeout: PT5M # Close connections that have been idle for 5 minutes
  max-concurrent-requests: NNNN # Maximum number of concurrent requests. -1 is unlimited.
  max-tcp-connections: NNNN     # Max number of concurrent tcp connections. -1 is unlimited.
  max-in-memory-entity: NNNNNN  # Entities smaller than this are buffered in memory vs streamed (bytes)
  max-payload-size: NNNNNNN     # Reject requests with payload sizes greater than this. -1 is unlimited (bytes)

  backlog: NNNN
  receive-buffer-size: NNNNN
  write-buffer-size: NNNNN
  write-queue-length: NN # 0 means direct write

  connection-options:

    connect-timeout: PT0S
    
    # Default (false: Nagle's algorithm enabled) is best for most cases. But for some OS and
    # workloads enabling TCP_NODELAY (disable Nagle's algorithm) can improve performance.
    tcp-no-delay: true|false

    # The default is TCP autotuning which is best for most cases.

    socket-receive-buffer-size: NNNNN

  # Protocol validation.
  # Careful with this! Can be dangerous if you turn these off.
