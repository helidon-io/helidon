The link:{openapi-spec-url}[OpenAPI specification] defines a standard way to express the interface exposed by a REST service.

The link:{microprofile-open-api-spec-url}[MicroProfile OpenAPI spec] explains how MicroProfile embraces OpenAPI, adding annotations, configuration, and a service provider interface (SPI).

ifdef::mp-flavor[Helidon {flavor-uc} implements the MicroProfile OpenAPI specification.]
ifdef::se-flavor[OpenAPI support in Helidon {flavor-uc} draws its inspiration from MicroProfile OpenAPI but does not implement the spec because Helidon {flavor-uc} does not support annotations.]

The OpenAPI support in Helidon {flavor-uc} performs
two main tasks:

* Build an in-memory model of the REST API your service implements.
* Expose the model in text format (YAML or JSON) via the `/openapi` endpoint.

:static-source-info: a static OpenAPI document file packaged as part of your service

To construct the model, Helidon gathers information about the service API from
ifdef::se-flavor[]
{static-source-info}.
endif::se-flavor[]
ifdef::mp-flavor[]
whichever of these sources are present in the application:

* {static-source-info};
+
* a _model reader_
+
The SPI defines an interface you can implement in your application for  programmatically providing part or all of the model;
* OpenAPI annotations;
* a _filter_ class
+
The SPI defines an interface you can implement in your application which can mask parts of the model.

==== Furnish OpenAPI information about your endpoints
// It's a bit odd to intermix the SE and MP content in this common file this way.
// But I tried having a level 3 section in the SE file include a sequence of
// level 4 sections from here, and that led to errors with headers being out of sequence.
// With the entire level 3 section here and conditional text for SE and MP, AsciiDoctor is happy.
ifdef::se-flavor[]
Your application supplies data for the OpenAPI model using a static OpenAPI file.
endif::[]

ifdef::mp-flavor[]
Helidon MP OpenAPI combines information from all of the following sources as it
builds its in-memory model of your application's API. It constructs the OpenAPI
document from this internal model. Your application can use one or more of these
techniques.

===== Annotations on the endpoints in your app
You can add MicroProfile OpenAPI annotations to the endpoints in your source code.
These annotations allow the Helidon MP OpenAPI runtime to discover the endpoints
and information about them via CDI at app start-up.

Here is one of the endpoints, annotated for OpenAPI, from the example mentioned earlier:

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/includes/openapi/OpenapiSnippets.java[tag=snippet_1, indent=0]
----
<1> `@Operation` gives information about this endpoint.
<2> `@APIResponse` describes the HTTP response and declares its media type and contents.

You can also define any request parameters the endpoint expects, although this
endpoint uses none.

This excerpt shows only a few annotations for illustration. The
link:{helidon-github-examples-url}/microprofile/openapi/basic[Helidon MP OpenAPI basic example] illustrates more,
and the link:{microprofile-open-api-spec-url}[MicroProfile OpenAPI spec] describes them all.

===== A static OpenAPI file
Add a static file at `META-INF/openapi.yml`, `META-INF/openapi.yaml`,
or `META-INF/openapi.json`. Tools such as Swagger let you describe your app's API
and they then generate an OpenAPI document file which you can include in your application
so OpenAPI can use it.

===== A model reader class your application provides
Write a Java class that implements the OpenAPI
link:{microprofile-open-api-javadoc-url}/OASModelReader.html[`org.eclipse.microprofile.openapi.OASModelReader`] interface. Your
model reader code programmatically adds elements to the internal model that OpenAPI
builds.

Then set the `mp.openapi.model.reader` configuration property to the fully-qualified name of your model reader class.

===== A filter class your application provides
Write a Java class that implements the OpenAPI link:{microprofile-open-api-javadoc-url}/OASFilter.html[`org.eclipse.microprofile.openapi.OASFilter`] interface.
Helidon invokes your filter methods for each element of the in-memory model, allowing your code to modify an element or completely remove it from the model.

Then set the `mp.openapi.filter` configuration property to the fully-qualified name of your filter class.

=== Accessing the REST Endpoint
Once you have added the {flavor-uc} OpenAPI dependency to your
ifdef::mp-flavor[project, then ]
ifdef::se-flavor[project, if you are using auto-discovery--or if you are not using auto-discovery and you have added code to register the `OpenApiFeature` object with your routing--then ]
your application responds to the built-in endpoint --
`/openapi` -- and returns the OpenAPI document describing the endpoints
in your application.

ifdef::mp-flavor[Per the MicroProfile OpenAPI spec, the]
ifdef::se-flavor[The]
default format of the OpenAPI document is YAML.
There is not yet an adopted IANA YAML media type, but a proposed one specifically
for OpenAPI documents that has some support is `application/vnd.oai.openapi`.
That is what Helidon returns by default.

In addition, a client can specify the HTTP header `Accept` as either `application/vnd.oai.openapi+json` or
`application/json` to request JSON. Alternatively, the client can pass the query parameter `format` as either `JSON`
or `YAML` to receive `application/json` or `application/vnd.oai.openapi` (YAML) output, respectively.

The link:{microprofile-open-api-spec-url}[MicroProfile OpenAPI specification] gives a listing and brief examples of the annotations you can add to your code to convey OpenAPI information.

The link:{microprofile-open-api-javadoc-base-url}[MicroProfile OpenAPI JavaDocs] give full details of the
ifdef::mp-flavor[annotations and the other]
classes and interfaces you can use in your code.

Remember that, although the JavaDocs describe annotations, Helidon {flavor-uc} does not support them.

=== Building the Jandex index

A Jandex index stores information about the classes and methods in your app and
what annotations they have. It allows CDI to process annotations faster during your
application's start-up, and OpenAPI uses the Jandex index to discover details about the types in your resource method signatures.

==== Indexing your project
Add an invocation of the link:https://github.com/smallrye/jandex/tree/main/maven-plugin[Jandex maven plug-in] to the `<build><plugins>`
section of your `pom.xml` if it is not already there:

[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>io.smallrye</groupId>
    <artifactId>jandex-maven-plugin</artifactId>
   <executions>
      <execution>
        <id>make-index</id>
      </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
----
When you build your app the plug-in generates the Jandex index `META-INF/jandex.idx` and `maven` adds it to
the application JAR.

==== Indexing dependencies
Invoking the Jandex plug-in as described above indexes only the types in your project. Some dependencies might include their own Jandex index and, in that case, OpenAPI finds information about the types in the dependency as well.

But if the signatures of your resource methods refer to types from dependencies that do not have their own indexes then you should customize how you use the plug-in.

The example below tailors the Jandex plug-in configuration to scan not only the current project but another dependency and to index a specific type from it.
[source,xml]
----
<execution>
    <id>make-index</id>
    <configuration> <!--1-->
        <fileSets>
            <fileSet>
                <dependency> <!--2-->
                    <groupId>jakarta.ws.rs</groupId>
                    <artifactId>jakarta.ws.rs-api</artifactId>
                </dependency>
                <includes> <!--3-->
                    <include>**/MediaType.class</include>
                </includes>
            </fileSet>
        </fileSets>
    </configuration>
</execution>

----
<1> Augments the default configuration.
<2> Adds a `fileSet` in the form of a `dependency` that is already declared in your project.
<3> Selects the type or types from the `fileSet` you want to include in the generated index.

You can add more than one dependency and scan for more than a single type. See the link:{helidon-github-examples-url}/microprofile/openapi/expanded-jandex[Helidon MP OpenAPI expanded Jandex example] for more information and a complete project that indexes a dependency.

[NOTE]
.Importance of Jandex Indexing
====
If your `pom.xml` _does not_ create
the Jandex index then the Helidon MP OpenAPI runtime automatically creates one in memory during
app start-up. This slows down your app start-up and, depending on how CDI is
configured, might inadvertently miss information.

We _strongly recommend_ using the Jandex plug-in to build the index into your app.

Further, if your resource method signatures refer to types from outside your project we _strongly recommend_ that you augment the Jandex plug-in invocation to include the dependencies and types your API uses. If you do not do so the resulting generated OpenAPI document is correct, but types that cannot be found are declared as `object` in the resulting OpenAPI model. This means your OpenAPI document contains less information about the types in your API than it otherwise could.
