== Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server

Helidon provides support for building Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers through a dedicated extension.
The MCP Server feature is not part of the core Helidon Framework – it is delivered as a separate project hosted in the
https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon-mcp[helidon-mcp GitHub repository].

=== What is MCP?

The https://modelcontextprotocol.io[Model Context Protocol (MCP)] is an open protocol designed to connect AI models with external tools, resources,
and data sources in a standardized way. An MCP server exposes resources, prompts, and tools that AI clients can
discover and invoke dynamically, enabling more powerful and context-aware applications.

=== Helidon MCP Server Extension

The Helidon MCP Server extension allows you to build and run MCP servers with Helidon.

Key points:

* Separate repository: https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon-mcp[helidon-mcp]
* Independent lifecycle: Requires Helidon but has its own versioning and release cadence
* Dedicated documentation: Full usage guides, configuration details, and examples are provided directly in the
  https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon-mcp#documentation[helidon-mcp documentation]

=== Next Steps

To get started:

. Visit the https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon-mcp[helidon-mcp GitHub repository].
. Follow the setup and usage instructions in the repository’s documentation.
. Explore how to expose your Helidon resources as MCP tools, prompts, and data sources.

== MCP Client

Helidon includes support for an MCP client through its xref:{rootdir}/se/ai/langchain4j/langchain4j.adoc#_mcp_client[integration with LangChain4j].
With this integration, you can set up the MCP client using Helidon configuration and plug it directly into your LangChain4j AI services.
