// tag::data_overview[]

Data repository queries are an abstraction over Object–Relational Mapping, or ORM. This enables
interfaces with query definitions to be translated into implementation classes at compile time.

The Helidon Data Repository supports Jakarta Persistence and major providers such as EclipseLink
and Hibernate.

----

The Jakarta Persistence provider, such as EclipseLink, and the JDBC driver, such as MySQL,
are required at runtime:

== Annotation Processor

Both the entity model and data repository interfaces require a specific annotation-processor configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<annotationProcessorPaths>
    <path>
        <groupId>io.helidon.bundles</groupId>
        <artifactId>helidon-bundles-apt</artifactId>
        <version>${helidon.version}</version>

        <artifactId>helidon-data-jakarta-persistence-codegen</artifactId>
        <version>${helidon.version}</version>
    </path>
</annotationProcessorPaths>
----

// end::data_annotation_processor[]

// tag::data_usage[]

== Usage

The Data Repository provides an API and tooling for implementing database queries through interface method
prototypes.

There are two ways in which such a query can be defined:

* using the method name as the query definition

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/includes/data/PetRepository.java[tag=findByName_method, indent=0]
----

* using a method annotated with `@Data.Query`

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/includes/data/PetRepository.java[tag=listPets_method, indent=0]
----

// end::data_usage[]

// tag::data_config[]

== Helidon Config

You must configure the data repository before using it.

In the example below, Helidon Config sets up the data repository using the EclipseLink
provider and a MySQL database:

[source,yaml]
----
data:
  persistence-units:
    jakarta:
      - connection:
          username: "user"
          password: "password"
          url: "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/pets"
          jdbc-driver-class-name: "com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver"
          # EclipseLink properties
          properties:
            eclipselink.target-database: "MySQL"
            eclipselink.target-server: "None"
            jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.database.action: "none"
----

// end::data_config[]

// tag::data_repository_interface[]

== Repository Interface

Data repository interfaces are annotated with `@Data.Repository` and extend the `Data.GenericRepository`
interface.

The `@Data.Repository` annotation takes no arguments. The `Data.GenericRepository` declares no methods
but has two generic type parameters, `E` and `ID`. `E` represents the persistence entity type and `ID`
represents the type of the entity's primary key attribute. Composite primary keys are not supported.

The `Data.GenericRepository` interface is extended by additional interfaces that add specific features:

[cols="20%,80%"]
|===
|Interface |Description

|`Data.GenericRepository<E, ID>`
|Root interface with entity type and primary key type as generic arguments.

|`Data.BasicRepository<E, ID>`
|Extends `GenericRepository`; adds a set of basic entity life-cycle operations.

|`Data.CrudRepository<E, ID>`
|Extends `BasicRepository`; adds `insert` and `update` methods to provide full CRUD support.

|`Data.PageableRepository<E, ID>`
|Extends `GenericRepository`; adds pagination support.
|===

=== Repository Interface Methods

A repository interface may contain three kinds of methods:

* Methods inherited from an ancestor interface
* Methods with a query defined via the `@Data.Query` annotation
* Methods with a query defined via the method name

The following `PetRepository` interface contains all of these: inherited methods from `CrudRepository`,
the methods `findByName` and `listNameOrderByName` defined by method name, and `selectPetsByCategory`
defined by the `@Data.Query` annotation:

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/includes/data/PetRepository.java[tag=PetRepository_class, indent=0]
----

==== Method with Query Defined by Method Name

This method type infers the query based on the method name and does not use a specific annotation.

The general method name syntax is illustrated below:

image::data/qbmn_syntax.png[align="left",role="fit"]

All parts of the pattern are optional except the return type keyword, such as `get`, `find`, `list`,
`stream`, `count` and `exists`.

===== Method Name Prefix and Return Type

A method can have a user-defined prefix. The prefix is a sequence of letters and digits that does not
match any return type keyword. This prefix has no influence on the query and can be used to distinguish
between methods that have the same query but different return types. If a prefix is used, the following
query return type keyword must start with a capital letter.

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/includes/data/PetRepositorySnippets.java[tag=qbmn_method, indent=0]
----

The query return type depends on the return type keyword:

[cols=3*]
|===
|Keyword |Return Type |Description

|count
|Numeric type
|Number of rows matching the query criteria

|exists
|`boolean` or `Boolean`
|Whether at least one matching row exists

|get
|Query row type
|Single result that throws an exception if there are zero or multiple results

|find
|`Optional<…>`
|Zero or single result that throws an exception if there are multiple results

|list
|`Collection` or `List`
|All matching rows

|list
|`Slice` or `Page`
|Pageable result set

|stream
|`Stream`
|Stream of matching rows
|===

NOTE: Validation of the keyword–return type mapping is not fully enforced by the code generator,
though this may change in future releases.

===== Projection in Method Name

The projection part is optional and follows directly after the return-type keyword. It consists
of `expression` and `property` components:

[cols=3*]
|===
|Keyword |Example |Description

|Distinct
|`listDistinctNameByTrainer_Name`
|Returns only unique values.

|First<number>
|`listFirst10ByAge`
|Returns up to `<number>` rows.

|Min
|`getMinPoints`
|Returns the minimum property value. Requires numeric type.

|Max
|`getMaxPoints`
|Returns the maximum property value. Requires numeric type.

|Sum
|`getSumPoints`
|Returns the sum of values. Requires numeric type.

|Avg
|`getAvgPoints`
|Returns the average value. Requires floating point type.
|===

The `property` part is the entity property name and it can contain underscores. An underscore is interpreted
as a dot, which means navigation to a related entity attribute. For example, `Keeper_Name` on the `Pet` entity
translates to the JPQL query `SELECT p.keeper.name FROM Pet p`.

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/includes/data/SimpleSnippets.java[tag=simple_model, indent=0]
----

===== Criteria in Method Name

The criteria part of the method name is optional and represents the `WHERE` clause of the query.
It is a logical expression composed of individual conditions joined by the `AND` and `OR` operators.
A single criteria condition is the `property`, optionally followed by a set of criteria keywords.
For example, `NameIgnoreCaseNotEndsWith` consists of the entity property `name` and the keywords
`IgnoreCase`, `Not`, and `EndsWith`.

Criteria condition keywords are of two types:

* `IgnoreCase` and `Not` modifiers that can appear before the condition keyword
* the condition keyword itself, such as `EndsWith`

A condition keyword can consume method arguments. Each keyword consumes an exact number of arguments.
Method arguments are consumed in the same order as the condition keywords appear in the method name.

Criteria modifiers:

[cols="10%,90%"]
|===
|Keyword |Description

|Not
|Negates the next condition

|IgnoreCase
|Makes the next condition case-insensitive
|===

Supported condition keywords:

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/includes/data/PetRepositorySnippets.java[tag=qbmn_multiple_criteria_methods, indent=0]
----

NOTE: In JPQL, operator precedence places `AND` above `OR` as defined in Jakarta Persistence 3.1, section 4.6.6.
      The same rule applies to SQL.

===== Ordering in Method Name

The ordering part of the method name is optional and represents the `ORDER BY` clause of the query.
It is a list of ordering rules. A single ordering rule is the `property` optionally followed by
a direction keyword. If more than one ordering rule is present, the rules must be separated by direction
keywords, so only the last keyword is optional.

Ordering keywords:

[cols="10%,90%"]
|===
|Keyword |Description

|Asc
|The returned collection is sorted in ascending order.

|Desc
|The returned collection is sorted in descending order.
|===

The default direction is ascending when the keyword is omitted after the `property`.

===== Method Name Grammar

The formal grammar for method names is as follows:

[source,text]
----
        method-name  :: <query> | <delete>

        query        :: <action> [ <projection> ] [ "By" <criteria>  [ "OrderBy" <order> ] ]
                            | <all-action> "All" [ "OrderBy" <order> ]
        delete       :: <del-action> "By" <criteria> ] | <del-action> [ "All" ]

        action       :: <action-l> | <prefix> <action-u>
        all-action   :: <all-action-l> | [ <prefix> ] <all-action-u>
        del-action   :: "delete" | [ <prefix> ] "Delete"

        prefix       :: [a-zA-Z0-9]*
        action-l     :: "count" |  "exists" | "get" | <all-action-l>
        action-u     :: "Count" |  "Exists" | "Get" | <all-action-u>
        all-action-l :: "find" | "list" | "stream"
        all-action-u :: "Find" | "List" | "Stream"

        projection   :: [ <expression> ] [ <property> ]
        expression   :: "First" <number> [ "Distinct" ] | "Distinct"
                            | "Max" | "Min" | "Sum" | "Avg"
        property     :: <identifier> [ "_" <identifier> ]
        identifier   :: [a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*
        number       :: [0-9]+

        criteria     :: <condition> { <logical-operator> <condition> }
        condition    :: <property> [ [ "Not" ] [ "IgnoreCase" ] <operator>  ]
        operator     :: "After" | "Before" | Contains" | "EndsWith" | "StartsWith" | "Equal"
                            | "LessThan" | "LessThanEqual" | "GreaterThan" | "GreaterThanEqual"
                            | "Between" | "Like" | "In" | "Empty" | "Null" | "True" | "False"
        logical-operator :: "And" | "Or"

        order        :: <property> [ <direction> [ <order> ] ]
        direction    :: "Asc" | "Desc"
----

==== Method with Query Defined by `@Data.Query` Annotation

This method type must be annotated with `@Data.Query`. The annotation takes a single `String` value containing
the database query. Currently, JPQL is supported. Method arguments must match the query parameters:

* For named parameters, each named parameter in the query must correspond to a method argument
  with the same name. Order does not matter.

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/includes/data/PetRepository.java[tag=listPets_method, indent=0]
----

* For indexed parameters, each argument must appear in the same order as in the query. Indexing starts at `1`.

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/includes/data/PetRepositorySnippets.java[tag=selectKeeper_method, indent=0]
----

Supported return types include:

* the query row type such as an entity class, an entity attribute, or a custom projection
* `List`, `Collection`, `Stream`, or `Optional` with the query row type as the generic parameter
* `Page` or `Slice` with the query row type as the generic parameter

// end::data_repository_interface[]

// tag::data_pagination[]

== Pagination

Pagination allows the caller to split a returned data collection into individual pages. When pagination is used,
the repository method must have an argument of type `PageRequest`. The return type of the method is `Slice` or `Page`.
The `PageRequest` argument defines the page size and the page index, starting from `0`.

Returned page content types:

[cols="10%,90%"]
|===
|Name |Description

|Slice
|Contains the page data as a `List` or `Stream` and a `PageRequest` to retrieve this page.

|Page
|Contains the page data as a `List` or `Stream`, the total result size across all pages, and a `PageRequest`
 to retrieve this page.
|===

An example repository method with pagination:

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/includes/data/PetRepositorySnippets.java[tag=qbmn_slice_method, indent=0]
----

// end::data_pagination[]

// tag::data_dynamic_ordering[]

== Dynamic Ordering

The ordering part of the method name defines a static ordering rule that cannot be modified at runtime.
Dynamic ordering allows the caller to define an additional ordering rule at runtime. Dynamic ordering is triggered
by adding an argument of type `Sort` to the repository method. Both static and dynamic rules can be used together.

An example repository method with dynamic ordering:

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/includes/data/PetRepositorySnippets.java[tag=qbmn_dynamic_sort_method, indent=0]
----

Static ordering rules from the method name are always applied first, and dynamic rules are added after them:

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/includes/data/PetRepositorySnippets.java[tag=qbmn_dual_sort_method, indent=0]
----

// end::data_dynamic_ordering[]

// tag::data_session_access_1[]

== Persistence Session Access

The caller can access the persistence provider session to implement more complex tasks that the framework does not
support directly. This feature is available to a data repository interface that extends the `Data.SessionRepository<S>` interface.

The generic argument `S` is the persistence session type, for example `EntityManager`.
The `Data.SessionRepository` interface provides methods that supply a session managed by the data repository framework,
so there is no need to handle the session instance lifecycle.

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/includes/data/SimpleSnippets.java[tag=session_repository, indent=0]
----

The session instance is available through the `Data.SessionRepository<S>` interface methods `run` and `call`:

// end::data_session_access_1[]

// tag::data_session_access_2[]

NOTE: The session instance is valid only while `run` or `call` method is being executed. This instance must not
      be stored and used after this method has ended.

// end::data_session_access_2[]

// tag::data_transaction[]

== Transactions

Transaction handling is available through Helidon Transaction API.

To enable Helidon Transaction API, add the following dependency to your project’s `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>jakarta.transaction</groupId>
    <artifactId>jakarta.transaction-api</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Helidon JTA Transaction support, such as Narayana, may be provided at runtime to enable `JTA` transaction type:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.transaction</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-transaction-narayana</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
----

If JTA transaction support is not provided, Helidon Data runtime will use `RESOURCE_LOCAL` transaction type.

=== Transaction Types and Annotations

The `Tx` class defines several ways how transactional support can be applied to transactional method executions.
Those ways are defined in `Tx.Type` enum.
The `Tx` class also defines annotations that can be used to mark methods for transactional execution
based on `Tx.Type` enum.

[cols=3*]
|===
|Enum |Annotation |Description

|`MANDATORY`
|`@Mandatory`
|A transaction must already be in effect when a method executes. If called outside a transaction
 context, a `TxException` is thrown. If called inside a transaction context, method execution continues
 under that context.

|`NEW`
|`@New`
|A new transaction is started when a method executes. If called outside a transaction context, a new
 transaction is begun. If called inside a transaction context, the current transaction is suspended, a new
 transaction is begun, and the method execution continues inside this new transaction context.

|`NEVER`
|`@Never`
|No transaction must be in effect when a method executes. If called outside a transaction context, method
 execution continues outside a transaction context. If called inside a transaction context, a `TxException`
 is thrown.

|`REQUIRED`
|`@Required`
|A transaction will be in effect when a method executes. If called outside a transaction context,
 a new transaction is begun. If called inside a transaction context, method execution continues inside
 that transaction context.

|`SUPPORTED`
|`@Supported`
|A transaction may optionally be in effect when a method executes. If called outside a transaction
 context, method execution continues outside a transaction context. If called inside a transaction context,
 method execution continues inside that transaction context.

|`UNSUPPORTED`
|`@Unsupported`
|No transaction will be in effect when a method executes. If called outside a transaction context, method
 execution continues outside a transaction context. If called inside a transaction context, the current
 transaction is suspended, method execution continues outside a transaction context, and the previously
 suspended transaction is resumed after method execution completes.
|===

=== Transaction Methods

The `Tx` class provides several methods for executing tasks within a transaction:

[cols="20%,80%"]
|===
|Method |Description

|`transaction(Callable<T> task)`
|Executes a task with a managed transaction of type `REQUIRED`.

|`transaction(Type type, Callable<T> task)`
|Executes a task with a managed transaction of the specified type.

|`transaction(CheckedRunnable<Exception> task)`
|Executes a task with a managed transaction of type `REQUIRED` without returning a result.

|`transaction(Type type, CheckedRunnable<Exception> task)`
|Executes a task with a managed transaction of the specified type without returning a result.
|===

=== Usage

The `Tx.Type` enum is used to control the transactional behavior of methods. By specifying the desired transactional
behavior using one of the enum values, developers can ensure that their methods are executed with the correct transactional
context.
For example, using `REQUIRED` ensures that a method is always executed within a transaction, while using `NEVER` ensures
that a method is never executed within a transaction.

In this example, the `doSomething()` method is annotated with `@Tx.Required`, ensuring that it is always executed within
a transaction. The `doSomethingElse()` method is annotated with `@Tx.Never`, ensuring that it is never executed within
a transaction:

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/includes/data/SimpleSnippets.java[tag=data_transaction_annotations, indent=0]
----

`PetService` class instance is obtained from service registry.

In this example, lambda expression in the `doSomething()` method is executed using `Tx.transaction` method with
`Tx.Type.REQUIRED` argument, ensuring that it is always executed within a transaction. Lambda expression
in the `doSomethingElse()` method is executed  using `Tx.transaction` method with `Tx.Type.NEVER` argument, ensuring
that it is never executed within a transaction:

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/includes/data/SimpleSnippets.java[tag=data_transaction_methods, indent=0]
----

// end::data_transaction[]
