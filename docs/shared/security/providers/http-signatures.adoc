==== Configuration options
The following table shows all configuration options of the provider and their default values

[cols="2,2,5"]

|===
|key |default value |description

|`optional` |`false` |If set to `true`, failure to authenticate will return `ABSTAIN` result instead of `FAILURE`. This is
    an important distinction when more than one provider is used
|`realm` | `helidon` |Realm used for challenge when request does not have a signature
|`headers` | `[SIGNATURE,AUTHORIZATION]` |Headers to look for inbound signatures and to store outbound signatures
|`sign-headers` | `always = ["date"]` |Headers to be signed
|`sign-headers.*.method` |default for all methods |Method this configuration is valid for
|`sign-headers.*.always` | {nbsp} |Array of headers to be always required in the request signature
|`sign-headers.*.if-present` |{nbsp} |Array of headers to be part of the signatures if present in the request
|`inbound` |{nbsp} |Configuration of inbound traffic for authenticating incoming requests
|`inbound.keys` |{nbsp} |Configuration of signature keys to verify incoming requests
|`inbound.keys.*.key-id` |{nbsp} |Key id as used in inbound signature to find the correct certificate/hmac configuration to verify the signature
|`inbound.keys.*.principal-name` |{nbsp} |The principal name (or user name) asserted when the signature is valid
|`inbound.keys.*.principal-type` |`SERVICE` |The type of principal to assert (can be `USER`)
|`inbound.keys.*.algorithm` |according to other configuration |`hmac-sha256` or `rsa-sha256` is assumed if other configuration options for that type are set
|`inbound.keys.*.hmac.secret` |{nbsp} |Secret shared by the service that signed the request and this service for `hmac-sha256` algorithm
|`inbound.keys.*.public-key` |{nbsp} |Public key configuration, implies `rsa-sha256` algorithm
|`inbound.keys.*.public-key.keystore` |{nbsp} |Keystore configuration for public key - full configuration as defined by `KeyStore` class
|`outbound` |{nbsp} |A list of outbound configurations
|`outbound.*.name` |{nbsp} |Required name of outbound configuration
|`outbound.*.username` |{nbsp} |Optional username used for outbound security; if not provided, current identity is propagated
|`outbound.*.password` |{nbsp} |Optional password used for outbound security
|`outbound.*.transports` |any transport |An array of transports this outbound configuration should be used for
|`outbound.*.hosts` |any host |An array of hosts this outbound configuration should be used for, can be a regular expression
|`outbound.*.paths` |any path |An array of paths this outbound configuration should be used for (such as `/greet`), can be a regular expression
|`outbound.*.methods` |any method |An array of HTTP methods this outbound configuration should be used for
|`outbound.*.signature` |{nbsp} |Configuration related to outbound signature configuration
|`outbound.*.signature.key-id` |{nbsp} |Key id to use in the outbound signature (to map to appropriate public key in target service's configuration)
|`outbound.*.signature.hmac.secret` |{nbsp} |Shared secret for hmac
|`outbound.*.signature.private-key` |{nbsp} |Private key configuration for rsa based signatures
|`outbound.*.signature.private-key.keystore` |{nbsp} |Keystore configuration for private key - full configuration as defined by `KeyStore` class

==== Signature basics

* standard: based on https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-cavage-http-signatures-03
* key-id: an arbitrary string used to locate signature configuration - when a
request is received the provider locates validation configuration based on this
id (e.g. HMAC shared secret or RSA public key). Commonly used meanings are: key
fingerprint (RSA); API Key

==== How does it work?

*Inbound Signatures*
We act as a server and another party is calling us with a signed HTTP request.
We validate the signature and assume identity of the caller.

*Outbound Signatures*
We act as a client and we sign our outgoing requests.
If there is a matching `outbound` target specified in configuration,
 its configuration will be applied for signing the outgoing request,
 otherwise there is no signature added
