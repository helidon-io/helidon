=== Header Authentication Provider
:description: Helidon Security Header Provider
:keywords: helidon, security, header

Asserts user or service identity based on a value of a header.

==== Setup

[source,xml]
.Maven dependency
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.security.providers</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-security-providers-header</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

[source,text]
.Provider class name
----
io.helidon.security.providers.header.HeaderAtnProvider
----

[source,text]
.Provider configuration key
----
header-atn
----

==== Example code

[source,yaml]
.Configuration example
----
security:
  providers:
    header-atn:
      atn-token:
        header: "X-AUTH-USER"
      outbound:
        - name: "internal-services"
          hosts: ["*.example.org"]
          # propagates the current user or service id using the same header as authentication
        - name: "partner-service"
          hosts: ["*.partner.org"]
          # propagates an explicit username in a custom header
          username: "service-27"
          outbound-token:
            header: "X-Service-Auth"
----

==== Configuration options
The following table shows all configuration options of the provider and their default values

[cols="2,2,5"]

|===
|key |default value |description

|`optional` |`false` |If set to `true`, failure to authenticate will return `ABSTAIN` result instead of `FAILURE`. This is
    an important distinction when more than one provider is used
|`authenticate` |`true` |If set to `false`, authentication will not be attempted (outbound security can still be used)
|`propagate` |`false` |If explicitly set to `false`, identity propagation will not be done. Otherwise it is done if an `outbound`
                section is configured
|`principal-type` |`USER` |Can be `USER` or `SERVICE`
|`atn-token` |`none` | Token extraction and propagation, you can define which header to use and how to extract it
|`outbound` |{nbsp} |A list of outbound configurations
|`outbound.*.name` |{nbsp} |Required name of outbound configuration
|`outbound.*.username` |{nbsp} |Optional username used for outbound security; if not provided, current identity is propagated
|`outbound.*.transports` |any transport |An array of transports this outbound configuration should be used for
|`outbound.*.hosts` |any host |An array of hosts this outbound configuration should be used for, can be a regular expression
|`outbound.*.paths` |any path |An array of paths this outbound configuration should be used for (such as `/greet`), can be a regular expression
|`outbound.*.methods` |any method |An array of HTTP methods this outbound configuration should be used for
|`outbound.*.outbound-token` |same as `atn-token` |Configuration of outbound header used to propagate
|`outbound.*.outbound-token.header` |{nbsp} |Name of the header used to propagate the token
|`outbound.*.outbound-token.prefix` |{nbsp} |Prefix for the header value, such as `"username "` (only one of `prefix`, `regexp` and `format` should be defined, `regexp` wins over `prefix`, `format` wins over `regexp`)
|`outbound.*.outbound-token.format` |{nbsp} |String format with a single parameter to create the header value, such as `"username %1s"`
|`outbound.*.outbound-token.regexp` |{nbsp} |Regular expression to create the header value, such as `"username (.*)"`
|===

==== How does it work?
This provider inspects a specified request header and extracts the username/service name from it and
asserts it as current subject's principal.

This can be used when we use perimeter authentication (e.g. there is a gateway that takes
care of authentication and propagates the user in a header).

*Identity propagation*

Identity is propagated only if an outbound target matches the target service.

The following options exist when propagating identity:
1. We propagate the current username using the configured header
2. We use username associated with an outbound target (see example configuration above)


*Caution*

When using this provider, you must be sure the header cannot be explicitly configured by a user or another service.
All requests should go through a gateway that removes this header from inbound traffic, and only configures it for
authenticated users/services.
Another option is to use this with fully trusted parties (such as services within a single company, on a single
protected network not accessible to any users), and of course for testing and demo purposes.
