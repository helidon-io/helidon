== Traced spans

The following table lists all spans traced by Helidon components:

|===
|component      |span name              |description

|`web-server`   |`HTTP Request`         |The overall span of the Web Server from request intitiation until response
Note that in `Zipkin` the name is replaced with `jax-rs` span name if `jax-rs` tracing
is used.
|`web-server`   |`content-read`         |Span for reading the request entity
|`web-server`   |`content-write`        |Span for writing the response entity
|`security`     |`security`             |Processing of request security
