:open-metrics-spec-exemplars: https://github.com/OpenObservability/OpenMetrics/blob/main/specification/OpenMetrics.md#exemplars

Add Helidon {h1Prefix} support for  link:{open-metrics-spec-exemplars}[OpenMetrics (Prometheus) exemplars] for histograms, counters, and simple timers to your application simply by adding dependencies to your project's `pom.xml`.

== Prerequisites

Declare the following dependency in your project:

[source,xml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.metrics</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-metrics-trace-exemplar</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
----

Also, include either xref:{zipkinPageRef}[Helidon Zipkin] or xref:{jaegerPageRef}[Helidon Jaeger] support:
include::{zipkinSharedPage}[tag=zipkin-dependency]
or
include::{jaegerSharedPage}[tag=jaeger-dependency]

Be sure Zipkin or Jaeger, whichever you chose, is running and accessible to your server.

== Interpreting Exemplars

//[quote,Mirriam-Webster Dictionary,'link:https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/exemplar[exemplar]'']

//exemplar - one that serves as a model or example

When you add the `helidon-metrics-trace-exemplar` dependency--and one for either Zipkin or Jaeger--to your application, Helidon automatically records a sample (label, value, and timestamp) with each update to a histogram, simple timer, or counter. Helidon adds the label, value, and timestamp to the OpenMetrics output returned from the Helidon metrics endpoint (`/metrics` unless you set it up otherwise).

<1> This exemplar is a sample with value at least as close to the mean as any other sample.
<2> This exemplar is for an exact sample with value the same as the maximum value the timer has observed.

----
<1> The exemplar for a `SimpleTimer` is the same for the `total` and the `elapsedTime` submetrics: always the most recent sample which updated the `SimpleTimer`.

Helidon adds an exemplar to the output for each statistical value--such as minimum, maximum, mean, and quantiles--for histograms, timers, simple times, and for counters. The exemplar information describes a single, actual sample that is representative of the statistical value.
Helidon chooses the representative examplar for each value using information that is already recorded for each type of metric:

. If a metric necessarily corresponds to a specific sample--for example a minimum or maximum--Helidon associates a sample that has that exact value as the exemmplar for the metric.
. If a metric collects samples into bins (quantiles), Helidon associates a sample from that bin with the bin's output.
. If a metric maintains running statistics (counts, totals), Helidon associates the most recent sample for that metric.
. If Helidon computes a metric's value from a number of samples--for example, mean--Helidon associates a sample for which its value is at least as close as other samples to the statistical calculation.

In cases with multiple representative samples (for example, two samples' values are equally close to the mean), Helidon chooses one of them arbitrarily.
