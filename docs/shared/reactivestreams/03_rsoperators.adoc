== Reactive Streams Operators

Implementation of
https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-reactive-streams-operators-1.0.1/microprofile-reactive-streams-operators-spec.html[MicroProfile Reactive Streams Operators]
specification. A standardised tool for manipulation with https://www.reactive-streams.org/[Reactive Streams],
provides set of operators as so called stages,
and the builders to prepare graphs of stages for streams to be build from.

[source,java]
.Example of simple closed graph usage:
----
AtomicInteger sum = new AtomicInteger();

ReactiveStreams.of("1", "2", "3", "4", "5")
.limit(3)
.map(Integer::parseInt)
.forEach(sum::addAndGet)
.run()
.whenComplete((r, t) -> System.out.println("Sum: " + sum.get()));

> Sum: 6

[[terms]]
.Operators(Stages)
|===
|fromIterable | Create new PublisherBuilder from supplied Iterable
|of | Create new PublisherBuilder emitting supplied elements
|ofNullable | Empty stream if supplied item is null
|iterate | Create infinite stream with every next item created by supplied operator from previous item
|generate| Create infinite stream with every item created by invocation of supplier
|empty| Create new PublisherBuilder emitting as a first thing complete signal
|failed| Create new PublisherBuilder emitting as a first thing error signal
|concat| Concat two streams
|coupled| Two parallel streams sharing cancel, onError and onComplete signals
|limit| Limit the size of the stream, when limit is reached completes
|peek| Invoke consumer for every item passing this operator
|filter| Drop item when expression result to false
|map| Transform items
|flatMap| Flatten supplied stream to current stream
|flatMapIterable| Flatten supplied iterable to current stream
|flatMapCompletionStage| Map elements to completion stage and wait for each to be completed, keeps the order
|flatMapRSPublisher| Map elements to Publishers and flatten this sub streams to original stream
|takeWhile| Let items pass until expression is true, first time its false completes
|dropWhile| Drop items until expression is true, first time its false let everything pass
|skip| Drop first n items
|distinct| Let pass only distinct items
|via| Connect supplied processor to current stream return supplied processor
|onError| Invoke supplied consumer when onError signal received
|onErrorResume| Emit one last supplied item when onError signal received
|onErrorResumeWith| When onError signal received continue emitting from supplied publisher builder
|onErrorResumeWithRsPublisher| When onError signal received continue emitting from supplied publisher
|onComplete| Invoke supplied runnable when onComplete signal received
|onTerminate| Invoke supplied runnable when onComplete or onError signal received
|to| Connect this stream to supplied subscriber
|toList| Collect all intercepted items to List
|collect| Collect all intercepted items with provided collector
|forEach| Invoke supplied Consumer for each intercepted item
|ignore| Ignore all onNext signals, wait for onComplete
|reduce| Reduction with provided expression
|cancel| Cancel stream immediately
|findFirst| Return first intercepted element

=== Graphs
https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-reactive-streams-operators-1.0.1/microprofile-reactive-streams-operators-spec.html#_graphs[Graphs]
are pre-prepared stream builders with
https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-reactive-streams-operators-1.0.1/microprofile-reactive-streams-operators-spec.html#_stages[stages],
which can be combined together to closed graph with methods `via` and `to`.

[source,java]
.Combining the graphs and running the stream:
----
        // Assembly of stream, nothing is streamed yet
        PublisherBuilder<String> publisherStage =
                ReactiveStreams.of("foo", "bar")
                        .map(String::trim);

        ProcessorBuilder<String, String> processorStage =
                ReactiveStreams.<String>builder()
                        .map(String::toUpperCase);

        SubscriberBuilder<String, Void> subscriberStage =
                ReactiveStreams.<String>builder()
                        .map(s -> "Item received: " + s)
                        .forEach(System.out::println);

        // Execution of pre-prepared stream
        publisherStage
                .via(processorStage)
                .to(subscriberStage).run();

> Item received: FOO
> Item received: BAR
