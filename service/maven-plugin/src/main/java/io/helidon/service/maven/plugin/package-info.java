/**
 * Maven plugin for Helidon Service Inject.
 * <p>
 * This plugin should be used by the application - i.e. the actual microservice that is going to be deployed and started.
 * This plugin will not help when used on a library.
 * <p>
 * The plugin generates application binding (mapping of services to injection points they satisfy), and application main class
 * to avoid lookups (binding), and reflection and resources discovery from classpath (main class).
