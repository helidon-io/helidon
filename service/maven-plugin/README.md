Maven Plugin
---

The Helidon Service Maven Plugin provides the following goals:

1. Create application artifacts (`create-application`, `create-test-application`)

# Create application artifacts Maven goals

This goal creates artifacts that are only valid for the service (assembled from libraries and its own sources).

This goal generates application binding - a mapping of services to injection points (to bypass runtime lookups), and of service
descriptors (to bypass runtime service discovery and reflection) - generates class `ApplicationBinding`

The binding class is expected to be used from a custom main class, similar to the following:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    // this will disable service discovery
    ServiceRegistryManager.start(Application__Binding.create());
}
```

To use a generated main class, enable it with the maven plugin, and an `ApplicationMain` class will be code generated with
a similar content.

Usage of this plugin goal is not required, yet it is recommended for final application module, it will add

- binding for injection points, to avoid runtime lookups
- explicit registration of all services into `ServiceRegistryConfig`, to avoid resource lookup and reflection at runtime
- overall speedup of bootstrapping, as all the required tasks to start a service registry are code generated

This goal should not be used for library modules (i.e. modules that do not have a Main class that bootstraps registry).

## Usage

Goal names:

- `create-application` - for production sources
- `create-test-application` - for test sources (only creates binding, main class not relevant)
