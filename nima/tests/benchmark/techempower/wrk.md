wrk benchmark
---

Using the `wrk` tool with the following configurations:

- must run from this directory, as the `pipeline.lua` script is used
- must have `tfb-server` in `/etc/hosts`

The setup is the same as the one used in TechEmpower benchmark, only running longer (TechEmpower runs for 15s)

You can use th script `benchmark.sh` to run full benchmark suite locally
