# JMH

JMH tests are being executed with maven profile `mvn clean install -Pjmh`, baseline result is created if
file `benchmarks/jmh/jmh-baseline.json` doesn't exist. Baseline is used for current result comparison, if regression larger than
error margin(15% by default)
is detected, build fails.

## Adding JMH tests

New JMH tests classes should be created in `benchmarks/jmh/src/main/java/io/helidon/tests/benchmark/jmh/`
with simple name ending with `JMHTest`.

## Troubleshooting

When tests fails repeatedly without any code change, try regenerating baseline file
with `mvn clean install -Pjmh -Dnima.jmh.resetBaseline=true`. If that doesn't help, you can also set different error margin (in
percents) with
`mvn clean install -Pjmh -Dnima.jmh.errorMargin=15`.
