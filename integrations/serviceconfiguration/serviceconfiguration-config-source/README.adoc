= Service Configuration `ConfigSource` Implementation

NOTE: This project is deprecated and slated for removal.

This project implements a MicroProfile Config `ConfigSource` in terms
of the Helidon Service Configuration API.

== Installation

Ensure that the `serviceconfiguration-config-source` artifact and its
dependencies are on your runtime classpath.

== Usage

You use the Service Configuration `ConfigSource` Implementation
indirectly: by using the normal
https://javadoc.io/doc/org.eclipse.microprofile.config/microprofile-config-api/1.2.1[MicroProfile
Config APIs].  The presence of the Service Configuration
`ConfigSource` Implementation artifact on your runtime classpath is
enough to cause it to be consulted in the normal course of acquiring
configuration information through the MicroProfil Config API.
