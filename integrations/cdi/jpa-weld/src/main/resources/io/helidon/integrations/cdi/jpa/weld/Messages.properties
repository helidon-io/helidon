transactionTypeMismatch=A resource-local EntityManagerFactory was requested for \
                        the persistence unit named "{0}", but a JTA \
                        EntityManagerFactory, {1}, was previously associated \
                        with the persistence unit.
persistenceUnitNameMismatch=The sole PersistenceUnitInfo, {0}, representing \
                            the persistence unit with name "{1}", will be used \
                            instead of the requested persistence unit named \
                            "{2}"
deprecated=This extension is no longer needed and is slated for removal.
