= Helidon JTA Weld Integration

The Helidon JTA Weld Integration project performs the
CDI-provider-specific work of integrating a JTA implementation into
standalone CDI applications (including those based on Helidon
MicroProfile).  It is one of two projects that together make up
overall JTA support for standalone CDI applications.

To function properly, this project also requires:

* a CDI-provider-agnostic counterpart, such as the `jta-cdi` project
  found elsewhere in this git repository

IMPORTANT: Please note that this feature is currently experimental and
           not suitable for production use.

== Installation

Ensure that the Helidon JTA Weld Integration project and its runtime
dependencies are present on your application's runtime classpath.

Please see the `examples/integrations/cdi/jpa` project found elsewhere
in this git repository for a working `pom.xml` file that uses this project.
