= Helidon JPA CDI Integration

The Helidon JPA CDI Integration project performs the
provider-independent work of integrating JPA into standalone CDI
applications (including those based on Helidon MicroProfile).  It is
one of several projects that together make up overall JPA support for
standalone CDI applications.

To function properly, this project also requires:

* a CDI-provider-specific counterpart, such as the `jpa-weld` project
  found elsewhere in this git repository
* a JPA provider implementation, such as Eclipselink
* a JPA-provider-specific library to assist the JPA provider in
  determining what kind of environment it is running in, such as the
  `eclipselink-cdi` project found elsewhere in this git repository
* a library capable of integrating `DataSource`s into CDI, such as the
  `datasource-hikaricp` project found elsewhere in this git repository
* a suitable JDBC-compliant database driver library

IMPORTANT: Please note that this feature is currently experimental and
           not suitable for production use.

== Installation

Ensure that the Helidon JPA CDI Integration project and its runtime
dependencies are present on your application's runtime classpath.

Please see the `examples/integrations/cdi/jpa` project found elsewhere
in this git repository for a working `pom.xml` file.
