ambiguousPersistenceUnitInfo = \
    There was at least one @PersistenceContext- or @PersistenceUnit-annotated injection point that did not specify a value for \
    its unitName element, and the following persistence units were found: {0}
mixedSynchronizationTypes = \
    An instance of CdiTransactionScopedEntityManager is already affiliated with the current transaction, but has a different \
    synchronization type than that desired.  Instigating bean: {0}; existing contextual instance: {1}
noTransactionSupport = \
    javax.transaction classes are not available.  Container-managed EntityManagers will not be supported.
noValidatorFactoryClass = \
    The javax.validation.ValidatorFactory class could not be loaded.  Consequently a ValidatorFactory instance will not be set \
    as the value of the javax.persistence.validation.factory EntityManagerFactory property.
persistenceContextNameIgnored = \
    There is a PersistenceContext annotation on the {0} annotated element with a non-empty name element value ("{1}").  Note \
    that the name element of the PersistenceContext annotation is always ignored.  Use the unitName element instead.
preexistingExtendedEntityManager = \
    There is already a javax.transaction.TransactionScoped EntityManager associated with the current transaction. Bean: \
    {0}; existing EntityManager: {1}
resourceLocalPersistenceUnitDisallowed = \
    The persistence unit {0} has a PersistenceUnitTransactionType of PersistenceUnitTransactionType.RESOURCE_LOCAL, but \
    container-managed persistence units must have a PersistenceUnitTransactionType of PersistenceUnitTransactionType.JTA.
