experimental=JPA support is currently experimental and not suitable for \
             production use.
mixedSynchronizationTypes = \
    An instance of CdiTransactionScopedEntityManager is already affiliated with the current transaction, but has a different \
    synchronization type than that desired.  Instigating bean: {0}; existing contextual instance: {1}
noValidatorFactoryClass = \
    The javax.validation.ValidatorFactory class could not be loaded.  Consequently a ValidatorFactory instance will not be set \
    as the value of the javax.persistence.validation.factory EntityManagerFactory property.
preexistingExtendedEntityManager = \
    There is already a javax.transaction.TransactionScoped EntityManager associated with the current transaction. Bean: \
    {0}; existing EntityManager: {1}
resourceLocalPersistenceUnitDisallowed = \
    The persistence unit {0} had a PersistenceUnitTransactionType of PersistenceUnitTransactionType.RESOURCE_LOCAL, but \
    container-managed  persistence units must have a PersistenceUnitTransactionType of PersistenceUnitTransactionType.JTA.
