= Helidon JTA CDI Integration

The Helidon JTA CDI Integration project performs the
CDI-provider-agnostic work of integrating a JTA implementation into standalone CDI
applications (including those based on Helidon MicroProfile).  It is
one of two projects that together make up overall JTA support for
standalone CDI applications.

To function properly, this project also requires:

* a CDI-provider-specific counterpart, such as the `jta-weld` project
  found elsewhere in this git repository

IMPORTANT: Please note that this feature is currently experimental and
           not suitable for production use.

== Installation

Ensure that the Helidon JTA CDI Integration project and its runtime
dependencies are present on your application's runtime classpath.

Please see the `examples/integrations/cdi/jpa` project found elsewhere
in this git repository for a working `pom.xml` file that uses this project.
