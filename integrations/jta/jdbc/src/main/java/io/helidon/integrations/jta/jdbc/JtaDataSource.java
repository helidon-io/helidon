 * An {@link AbstractDataSource} and a {@link Synchronization} that wraps another {@link DataSource} that is known to
 * not behave correctly in the presence of JTA transaction management, such as one supplied by any of several freely and
 * commercially available connection pools, and that makes such a non-JTA-aware {@link DataSource} behave as sensibly as
 * possible in the presence of a JTA-managed transaction.
 *
 * <h2>Thread Safety</h2>
 *
 * <p>Instances of this class are safe for concurrent use by multiple threads. No such guarantee obviously can be made
 * about the {@link DataSource} wrapped by any given instance of this class.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that the JDBC specification places no requirement on any implementor to make any implementations of any JDBC
 * constructs thread-safe. Nevertheless, a certain amount of unspecified thread safety must exist in all JDBC
 * implementations or their constructs could never be enrolled in JTA-compliant transactions.</p>
 *
 * @deprecated This class is slated for removal. It makes incorrect assumptions about threading in a JTA environment.
 * Specifically, this class' implementation incorrectly assumes that the {@link #afterCompletion(int)} method will be
 * invoked on the same thread as the governing transaction, which is not necessarily the case, especially in the case of
 * asynchronous rollbacks.  As a result, {@link Connection}s acquired by instances of this class may not be closed
 * properly.
