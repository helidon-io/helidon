/**
 * The Helidon Injection API provide these annotation types that are typically used at compile time
 * to assign special meaning to the type. It is used in conjunction with Helidon tooling (see the {@code injection processor} and
 * injection {@code maven-plugin} modules) to create and validate the DI module at compile time.
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link io.helidon.inject.service.Injection.Contract} - signifies that the type can be used for lookup in the service
 * registry.</li>
 * <li>{@link io.helidon.inject.service.Injection.ExternalContracts} - same as Contract, but applied to the implementation
 * class instead.</li>
 * <li>{@link io.helidon.inject.service.Injection.RunLevel} - ascribes meaning for when the service should start.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Other types from the API are less commonly used, but are still made available for situations where programmatic access
 * is required or desirable in some way. The two most common types for entry into this part of the API are shown below.
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link io.helidon.inject.Services} - the services registry, which is one such service from this suite.</li>
 * </ul>
