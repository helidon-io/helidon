Helidon Inject Service
---

A minimal set of types required to declare a service, and to compile its code generated files.

- Declaring a service - see [Injection](./src/main/java/io/helidon/inject/service/Injection.java) - all annotations are hosted
  within this class, and all have class retention
- Adding interception support
    - `Interception.Trigger` - meta annotation for annotations that will cause interception at runtime
    - `Interception.Interceptor` - interceptor interface, implemented by service that can intercept calls
    - `InvocationContext` (and its blueprint) - parameter of intercept method
    - `Invoker` - abstraction of a method call, constructor call, or field assignment when injecting, used by generated code
- Compiling a generated service descriptor:
    - `ServiceDescriptor` - implemented by generated service descriptor)
    - `ServiceInfo` - supertype of `ServiceDescriptor`
    - `InjectionContext` - used in descriptor to inject into constructor, methods, or fields)
    - `InterceptionMetadata` - used in descriptor to support interception of constructor, field injection, or methods)
    - `Ip` (and its blueprint) - injection point metadata
- Providing metadata to Helidon Inject
    - `ModuleComponent` - a `ServiceLoader` provider interface implemented by each module, to bind service descriptors to service
      registry
    - `ServiceBinder` - binder implemented by the service registry
- Qualifier runtime types
    - `Qualifier` (and its blueprint) - extends `Annotation` and provides qualifier specific factory methods

The following types may be code generated for a module declaring a service:

- `*__ServiceDescriptor` - service metadata, factory method, and injection method, `implements Descriptor`
- `*__Intercepted` - extends the service type to support method interception (constructor interception, and field injection point
  interception is handled in generated `Descriptor`)
- `*__InjectSupplier` - a service wrapping Jakarta (or javax) provider and exposing it as a `Supplier` - only when using
  appropriate codegen extension
- `Injection__Module` - the `ModuleComponent` binding all descriptors to service registry
- `Injection__Application` - generated by a Maven plugin, this is the only exception that requires full Helidon Inject
  module on classpath, only intended for end user application that collects all libraries together
- `*__ConfigBean` - a `ServicesProvider` that uses config to create instances of the `@ConfigDriven.ConfigBean` types 

## Developer notes

This modules MUST be a compile & runtime dependency of any module that exposes services,
as the ModuleComponent is a ServiceLoader provider interface. As such, it must be set as
provides ModuleComponent with Injection__Module
in the module-info.java of the project. If a module provides a service, the module of the service must not be a static dependency.

For this reason, be very careful what you add to this module.

This module cannot be further split, as most of the types are required by `ModuleComponent`:

- `ModuleComponent`
- `ServiceBinder` - parameter of method in `ModuleComponent`
- `ServiceInfo` - supertype of `ServiceDescriptor`
- `ServiceDescriptor` - parameter of method in `ServiceBinder`
- `IpBlueprint` - used in multiple places in `ServiceDescriptor`
- `InjectionContext` - parameter of instantiate and inject methods in `ServiceDescriptor`
- `InterceptionMetadata` - parameter of instantiate and inject methods in `ServiceDescriptor`
- `Invoker` - used in `InterceptionMetadata`
- `Qualifier` - return type of method in `ServiceDescriptor`
- `Injection` (`ModuleComponent` is a `Contract`)

The only types that may be separated:

- `Interception.Interceptor` - implemented by user
- `InvocationContextBlueprint` - parameter of interceptor
