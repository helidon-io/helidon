/**
 * A config driven service is based on a prototype that is configured from the root of configuration
 * (see {@code Configured} in {@code helidon-config-metadata}).
 * <p>
 * The annotation is placed on the service implementation (not contract, as we need to understand which type to
 * instantiate), and the prototype is expected to be one of the constructor parameters (annotated with {@code @Inject}).
 * In case the configured prototype is repeatable, each instance will be named according to the name specified in configuration
 * either through {@code name} property, or the config node name.
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * <pre>
 * &#064;ConfigDriven(value = ServerConfig.class, activateByDefault  = true, atLeastOne = true)
 * class ServerImpl {
 *   &#064;Inject
 *   ServerImpl(ServerConfig sc) {
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
