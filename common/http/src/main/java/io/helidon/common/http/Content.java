/**
 * Represents an HTTP entity as a {@link Flow.Publisher publisher} of {@link DataChunk chunks} with specific
 * features.
 * <h3>Default publisher contract</h3>
 * Default publisher accepts only single subscriber. Other subscribers receives
 * {@link Flow.Subscriber#onError(Throwable) onError()}.
 * <p>
 * {@link DataChunk} provided by {@link Flow.Subscriber#onNext(Object) onNext()} method <b>must</b> be consumed in this
 * method call. Buffer can be reused by network infrastructure as soon as {@code onNext()} method returns.
 * This behavior can be inconvenient yet it helps to provide excellent performance.
 *
 * <h3>Publisher Overwrite.</h3>
 * It is possible to modify contract of the original publisher by registration of a new publisher using
 * {@link #registerFilter(Function)} method. It can be used to wrap or replace previously registered (or default) publisher.
 *
 * <h3>Entity Readers</h3>
 * It is possible to register function to convert publisher to {@link CompletionStage} of a single entity using
 * {@link #registerReader(Class, Reader)} or {@link #registerReader(Predicate, Reader)} methods. It
 * is then possible to use {@link #as(Class)} method to obtain such entity.
