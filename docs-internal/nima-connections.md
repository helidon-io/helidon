# Server Connection Providers

Níma server uses SPI to discover how to handle a specific incoming connection.
The main entry point is `ServerConnectionProvider` - a service loader provider interface to discover
which connections are supported.

We have the following implementations currently:

- `Http1ConnectionProvider` - support for the usual HTTP/1.1 connections
- `Http2ConnectionProvider` - support for "prior-knowledge" HTTP/2 connections

The connection provider creates a configured `ServerConnectionSelector`, which is then used at runtime.
The selector works based on initial bytes of the connection.

# HTTP/1.1 Upgrade Providers

HTTP/1.1 supports the concept of upgrading a connection. This is supported through
`Http1UpgradeProvider` - a service loader provider interface to discover which upgrades are supported.

We have the following implementations currently:

- `Http2UpgradeProvider` - upgrade to HTTP/2 using upgrade
- `WsUpgradeProvider` - upgrade to Níma WebSocket implementation
- `TyrusUpgradeProvider` - upgrade to MP Tyrus WebSocket implementation (higher weight than WsUpgradeProvider)

The upgrade provider creates a configured `Http1Upgrader`, which is then used at runtime.
Upgraders work based on protocol identificator (`h2c`, `websocket`). When more than one for the same protocol is configured,
the provider with higher weight will be used.

# Configurability

All of connection providers, HTTP/1.1 upgrade providers and HTTP/2 subprotocols are configured
under `server.connection-providers`, to have a single configuration of a protocol regardless whether this is accessed directly or
through upgrade mechanism.

The configuration key is the one provided by the Connection provider, HTTP/1.1 Upgrade provider, or HTTP/2 SubProtocol
provider `configKey()` or `configKeys()` method.

As all providers are configured on the same leave, each provider should have a descriptive and unique configuration key
relevant to its purpose.

Example of such configuration (Tyrus and Níma WebSocket both use `websocket`, as only one of them can be active):

```yaml
server:
  connection-providers:
    http_1_1:
      max-prologue-length: 4096
    websocket:
      origins: [ "origin1" ]
    http_2:
      max-frame-size: 128000
    grpc:
      something: "value"
```

Configuration levels:

- `io.helidon.nima.webserver.WebServer`
    - `io.helidon.nima.webserver.http.DirectHandlers` // should be configurable per socket, also HTTP only
    - `io.helidon.common.context.Context`
    - `io.helidon.nima.http.media.MediaContext` - should be configurable per socket, HTTP only
    - `io.helidon.nima.http.encoding.ContentEncodingContext` - should be configurable per socket, HTTP only
- `io.helidon.nima.webserver.ServerListener` (ListenerConfiguration)

# Server Context and other contexts

To access context related information of server and connection, the following types are available for connections:

- `io.helidon.nima.webserver.ListenerContext` - listener specific
    - Helidon Context
    - Media context
    - Content encoding context
- `io.helidon.common.socket.SocketContext` - socket specific (as in TCP socket)
    - remote and local peers
    - socket ids (client and server)
    - methods to log socket related information in a single format
- `io.helidon.nima.webserver.ConnectionContext extends SocketContext` - connection specific (established connection for a
  listener)
    - listener context
    - executor service
    - data writer
    - data reader
    - router

what we need

- access to server config/socket configuration (so we do not need to repeat the configuration again on contexts)
- should we use composition or inheritance?
