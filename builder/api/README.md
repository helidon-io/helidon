# Builder

## Description

There are two use cases we cover:

1. We need a type with a builder (we will use `Keys` as an example)
2. We need a runtime object, with a prototype with a builder (we will use `Retry` as an example)

For both use cases, we need to understand how to create instances, obtain builders etc.

### Type with a builder

For this simple approach, the user facing API will look as it does now:

```java
Keys keys=Keys.builder()
        .name("name")
        .build();
```

The "blueprint" of such type:

```java
import io.helidon.config.metadata.Configured;
import io.helidon.config.metadata.ConfiguredOption;

@Prototype.Blueprint
@Configured // support method config(Config) on the builder, and a static create(Config)
interface KeysBlueprint{
    @ConfiguredOption(required = true)
    String name();
            }
```

This will generate:

- `Keys extends KeysBlueprint` interface
- `Keys.BuilderBase implements Keys` base builder, to support extensibility of `Keys`
- `Keys.Builder extends Keys.BuilderBase, io.helidon.common.Builder<Builder, Keys>` inner class - the fluent API builder
  for `Keys`
- `Keys.BuilderBase.KeysImpl implements Keys` implementation of `Keys`

### Runtime object, blueprint, builder

For this approach, the user facing API will be similar to what we do now:

```java
Retry retry=Retry.builder() // method builder is not generated, must be hand coded, and will return "RetryPrototype.builder()"
        .build(); // generated, creates a Retry instance through a factory method defined on Retry or on RetryPrototypeBlueprint

        RetryPrototype prototype=RetryPrototype.builder()
        .buildPrototype(); // alternative build method to obtain the intermediate prototype object

        Retry retryFromSetup=prototype.build(); // to runtime type
```

The "blueprint" of such type:

```java
@Prototype.Blueprint
@Configured // support method config(Config) on the builder, and a static create(Config) method if desired
intrerface RetryPrototypeBlueprint extends Prototype.Factory<Retry> {
@ConfiguredOption(required = true)
    String name();
            }
```

## Types, interfaces

Annotations:

| `Prototype.SameGeneric`     | `false`  | Use for maps, where we want a setter method to use the same generic type for key and for value (such as `Class<T> key, T valuel`)                                                                            |
| `Prototype.Redundant`       | `false`  | A redundant option will not be part of generated `toString`, `hashCode`, and `equals` methods (allows finer grained control)                                                                                 |
| `Prototype.Confidential`    | `false`  | A confidential option will not have value visible when `toString` is called, only if it is `null` or it has a value (`****`)                                                                                 |
| `Prototype.CustomMethods`   | `false`  | reference a class that will contain declarations (all static) of custom methods to be added to the generated code, can add prototype, builder, and factory methods                                           |
| `Prototype.BuilderMethod`   | `false`  | Annotation to be placed on factory methods that are to be added to builder, first parameter is the `BuilderBase<?, ?>` of the prototype                                                                      |
| `Prototype.PrototypeMethod` | `false`  | Annotation to be placed on factory methods that are to be added to prototype, first parameter is the prototype instance                                                                                      |
| `RuntimeType.PrototypedBy`  | `true`   | Annotation on runtime type that is created from a `Prototype`, to map it to the prototype it can be created from, used to trigger annotation processor for validation                                        |

| `Prototype.Api`                | `true`    | all prototypes implement this interface                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `Prototype.Builder`            | `true`    | all prototype builders implement this interface, defines method `buildPrototype`                                                                                                                                                   |
| `Prototype.ConfiguredBuilder`  | `true`    | all prototype builders that support configuration implement this interface, defines method `config(Config)`                                                                                                                        |

## Configured providers

We can define a configured option as follows:
`@ConfiguredOption(key = "security-providers", provider = true, providerType = SecurityProviderProvider.class, providerDiscoverServices = false)`

Rules:

1. `providerType` MUST extend `io.helidon.common.config.ConfiguredProvider`
2. The method MUST return a `List` of the type the provider creates, so in this case we consider the `SecurityProviderProvider`
   to be capable of creating a `SecurityProvider` instance from configuration, so the return type would
   be `List<SecurityProvider>`, where `SecurityProvider extends NamedService` and  
   `SecurityProviderProvider extends ConfiguredProvider<SecurityProvider>`

This will expect the following configuration:

```yaml
security-providers:
  discover-services: true # optional, to override "providerDiscoverServices" option
  providers:
    - name: "my-provider"
      type: "http-basic"
      enabled: true
```

The generated code will read all nodes under `providers` and map them to an instance.
