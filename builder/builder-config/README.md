# builder-config

This module can be used at compile time or at runtime.

It extends <b>[Builder](../)</b> to offer <b>ConfigBean</b>, and the backing SPI supporting classes that integrates to <i>Pico Config-Driven Services</i> as well as <i>Helidon's Configuration</i> subsystems.

Usage is simple - use <i>@ConfigBean</i> instead of (or in addition to) <i>@Builder</i>.
