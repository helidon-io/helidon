## [1.0.0] - 2019-02-12

### Notes

This is our 1.0 release and we have finished the API changes that we've
been working on over the last few months. From this point on we will
have much greater API stability. Thanks for your patience.

If you are upgrading from 0.11.0 note that media support (for example JsonSupport)
has moved to a top level `media` component. This means you might have to change
your dependencies and Java imports. For more details see:
[API Changes](https://github.com/oracle/helidon/wiki/API-Changes-in-1.0). 

If you are upgrading from 0.10.5 or earlier you will need to change
your application due to a number of API changes we made in preperation
for 1.0. For details on API changes see:
[API Changes](https://github.com/oracle/helidon/wiki/API-Changes-in-1.0)

Helidon 1.0 supports [MicroProfile 1.2](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-bom/releases/download/1.2/microprofile-spec-1.2.pdf)
with updated versions of the components.

### Improvements

- WebServer: Add JSON-B (Yasson) support [388](https://github.com/oracle/helidon/pull/388)
- WebServer: Add Jackson support [351](https://github.com/oracle/helidon/pull/351)
- MicroProfile: update Hystrix to 1.5.18 [391](https://github.com/oracle/helidon/pull/391)
- Examples: Change quickstart examples so that PUT uses json and not path param [399](https://github.com/oracle/helidon/pull/399)

### Fixes

- WebServer: Fix for NullPointer when using Json support without configured charset [393](https://github.com/oracle/helidon/pull/393)

## [0.11.1] - 2019-02-07

### Notes

If you are upgrading from 0.10.5 or earlier you will need to change
your application (see Notes for 0.11.0 release). For details on API
changes see [API Changes](https://github.com/oracle/helidon/wiki/API-Changes-in-1.0)

If you are upgrading from 0.11.0 note that media support (for example JsonSupport)
has moved to a top level `media` component. Details
in [API Changes](https://github.com/oracle/helidon/wiki/API-Changes-in-1.0). 

Thanks for your patience with API changes. Once 1.0 is released this will
be behind us!

## [0.11.0] - 2019-01-11

### Notes

We've made a number of API changes for this release in preparation for our
1.0 release. This means when you upgrade to 0.11.0 you will need to make
