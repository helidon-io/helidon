## [4.0.0-ALPHA1]

We are pleased to announce Helidon 4.0.0-ALPHA1. This is the first Alpha build of Helidon 4.0.0 and is intended as a preview release only. Do not use this release in production. It is suitable only for experimentation. APIs are subject to change. Documentation is incomplete. And some functionality is experimental and not fully tested.

The big news in this build is the introduction of Helidon Nima -- a ground up webserver implementation based on JDK Project Loom. More information to come.

Helidon 4.0.0 is a major release that includes significant new features and fixes. As a major release it also includes some backward incompatible API changes.

### Notable Changes

- Java 19 early access (with Loom support) as the minimal Java version
- Using System.Logger instead of java util logging (incremental change)
- `HelidonServiceLoader` is now part of `helidon-common` module
- Introduction of `@Weight`, `Weighted` and `Weights` instead of `@Priority` and `Prioritized`, to base ordering on a double (allows to fit a component between any other two components), all modules using priority are refactored (except for MicroProfile where required by specifications).
  - higher weight means a component is more important 
  - moved priority related types to MP config (as that is the lowest level MP module)
  - replaces all instances in SE that use priority with weight (no dependency on Jakarta, predictible and easy to understand behavior)
- Introduction of `MediaType` as the abstraction of any media type, as used by Config, static content and HTTP in general. See `MediaType` and `MediaTypes`
- `MapperManager` now supports mapping qualifiers
- new `helidon-common-parameters` module contains an abstraction of a container that has named values (one or more); this is used in path parameters, query parameters, form parameters etc.
- new `helidon-common-uri` module contains URI abstraction (path with possible parameters, query, and fragment)
- Header processing now uses `HeaderName` and `HeaderValue` types. This allows you to prepare constants with custom names and values that
  are often reused. It also allows us to improve parsing speed of HTTP requests.
