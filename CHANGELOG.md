## [2.0.0-M1] 

### Notes

This is the first milestone release of Helidon 2.0. It contains significant new
features, enhancements and fixes. It also contains backward incompatible changes
(see [section](#backward-incompatible-changes) below ). This milestone release
is provided for customers that want early access to Helidon 2.0. It should be
considered unstable and is not intended for production use. APIs and features
might not be fully tested and are subject to change. Documentation is incomplete.
Those looking for a stable release should use a 1.4 release.

Notable changes:

- New Helidon DB Client
- Preliminary GraalVM native-image support for Helidon MP (in addition
  to existing support for Helidon SE)

### Backward incompatible changes

In order to stay current with dependencies, and also refine our APIs we have 
introduced some backward incompatible changes in this release. Most of the changes
are mechanical in nature: changing package names, changing GAV coordinates, etc.
Here are the details:

#### Java Runtime

- Java 8 support has been dropped. Java 11 or newer is now required.

#### Common
- Removed `io.helidon.reactive.Flow`, please use `java.util.concurrent.Flow`
- Removed `io.helidon.common.CollectionsHelper`, please use factory methods of `Set`, `Map` and `List`
- Removed `io.helidon.common.OptionalHelper`, please use methods of `java.util.Optional`
- Removed `io.helidon.common.StackWalker`, please use `java.lang.StackWalker`
- Removed `io.helidon.common.InputStreamHelper`, please use `java.io.InputStream` methods

#### Tracing
- We have upgraded to OpenTracing version 0.33.0 that is not backward compatible, the following breaking changes exist
    (these are OpenTracing changes, not Helidon changes):
    1. `TextMapExtractAdapter` and `TextMapInjectAdapter` are now `TextMapAdapter`
    2. module name changed from `opentracing.api` to `io.opentracing.api` (same for `noop` and `util`)
    3. `SpanBuilder` no longer has `startActive` method, you need to use `Tracer.activateSpan(Span)`
    4. `ScopeManager.activate(Span, boolean)` is replaced by `ScopeManager.activate(Span)` - second parameter is now always 
            `false`
    5. `Scope ScopeManager.active()` is removed - replaced by `Span Tracer.activeSpan()`
- If you use the `TracerBuilder` abstraction in Helidon and have no custom Spans, there is no change required    

#### Config
Meta configuration has been refactored to be done through `ServiceLoader` services. If you created
a custom `ConfigSource`, `PollingStrategy` or `RetryPolicy`, please have a look at the new documentation.

Config now implements MicroProfile config (not explicitly, you can cast between MP Config and Helidon Config).
There is a very small behavior change between MP methods and SE methods of config related to system
property handling:

    The MP TCK require that system properties are fully mutable (e.g. as soon as the property is changed, it
    must be used), so MP Config methods work in this manner (with a certain performance overhead).
    Helidon Config treats System properties as a mutable config source, with a time based polling strategy. So
    the change is reflected as well, though not immediately (this is only relevant if you use change notifications). 

#### Metrics
Helidon now supports only MicroProfile Metrics 2.x. Modules for Metrics 1.x were removed, and 
modules for 2.x were renamed from `metrics2` to `metrics`.

#### Security

- When OIDC provider is configured to use cookie (default configuration) to carry authentication information,
    the cookie `Same-Site` is now set to `Lax` (used to be `Strict`). This is to prevent infinite redirects, as 
    browsers would refuse to set the cookie on redirected requests (due to this setting).
    Only in case the frontend host and identity host match, we leave `Strict` as the default


#### Microprofile Bundles
We have removed all versioned MP bundles (i.e. `helidon-microprofile-x.x`, and introduced
unversioned core and full bundles:

- `io.helidon.microprofile.bundles:helidon-microprofile-core` - contains only MP Server
   and Config. Allows you to add only the specifications needed by your application.
- `io.helidon.microprofile.bundles:helidon-microprofile` - contains the latest full 
   MicroProfile version implemented by Helidon
   
You can find more information in this blog post:
[New Maven bundles](https://medium.com/helidon/microprofile-3-2-and-helidon-mp-1-4-new-maven-bundles-a9f2bdc1b5eb)

#### Helidon CDI and MicroProfile Server

- You cannot start CDI container yourself (this change is required so we can 
      support GraalVM `native-image`)
    - You can only run a single instance of Server in a JVM
    - If you use `SeContainerInitializer` you would get an exception
        - this can be worked around by configuration property `mp.initializer.allow=true`, and warning can be removed
            using `mp.initializer.no-warn=true`
        - once `SeContainerInitializer` is used, you can no longer use MP with `native-image` 
- You can no longer provide a `Context` instance, root context is now built-in
- `MpService` and `MpServiceContext` have been removed
    - methods from context have been moved to `JaxRsCdiExtension` and `ServerCdiExtension` that can be accessed
        from CDI extension through `BeanManager.getExtension`.
    - methods `register` can be used on current `io.helidon.context.Context`
    - `MpService` equivalent is a CDI extension. All Helidon services were refactored to CDI extension 
        (you can use these for reference)
- `Server.cdiContainer` is removed, use `CDI.current()` instead

#### Startup
New recommended option to start Helidon MP:
1. Use class `io.helidon.microprofile.cdi.Main`
2. Use meta configuration option when advanced configuration of config is required (e.g. `meta-config.yaml`)
3. Put `logging.properties` on the classpath or in the current directory to be automatically picked up to configure 
    Java util logging
    
`io.helidon.microprofile.server.Main` is still available, just calls `io.helidon.microprofile.cdi.Main` and is deprecated.
`io.helidon.microprofile.server.Server` is still available, though the features are much reduced


#### MicroProfile JWT-Auth
If a JAX-RS application exists that is annotated with `@LoginConfig` with value `MP-JWT`, the correct authentication
provider is added to security.
The startup would fail if the provider is required yet not configured.

#### Security in MP
If there is no authentication provider configured, authentication will always fail.
If there is no authorization provider configured, ABAC provider will be configured.
(original behavior - these were configured if there was no provider configured overall) 

### Other Behavior changes

- JAX-RS applications now work similar to how they work in application servers
    - if there is an `Application` subclass that returns anything from
      `getClasses` or `getSingletons`, it is used as is
    - if there is an `Application` subclass that returns empty sets from these methods,
      all available resource classes will be part of such an application
    - if there is no `Application` subclass, a synthetic application will be
      created with all available resource classes
    - `Application` subclasses MUST be annotated with `@ApplicationScoped`,
      otherwise they are ignored
