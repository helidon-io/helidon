## [4.0.0]

* WebServer no longer falls back to the default routing for additional sockets (in Helidon SE)
* Introduced `ServerFeature` concept, server feature can access routing builders for all sockets on WebServer
* SecurityFeature is now a WebServer feature
* ContextFeature is now a WebServer feature
* ObserveFeature is now a WebServer feature
* OpenApiFeature is now a WebServer feature
* CorsFeature is a new WebServer feature
* TracingFeature is now an observability feature
* Features use common config dependency - can still pass `io.helidon.Config` instance to them, only changes in SPI
* Metrics in SE now require user in `observe` role, or `metrics.permit-all` set to `true`, otherwise 403 is returned
* OpeanAPI in SE now requires user in `openapi` role, or `openapi.permit-all` set to `true`, otherwise 403 is returned

## [4.0.0-RC1]

This is the first RC build of Helidon 4.0.0 and is intended as a preview release only. Do not use this release in production. It is suitable only for experimentation. APIs are subject to change. Documentation is incomplete. And some functionality is experimental.

The big news in Helidon 4.0.0 is the introduction of Helidon Nima -- a ground up webserver implementation based on JDK Project Loom virtual threads. With Helidon 4 you get the high throughput of a reactive server with the simplicity of thread-per-request style programming.

Java 21 is required to use Helidon 4.0.0-RC1.

Notable Changes

* Major refactoring of APIs is complete.
* HTTP/2 support complete and other WebServer and WebClient features complete.

## [4.0.0-M2]


This is the second Milestone build of Helidon 4.0.0 and is intended as a preview release only. Do not use this release in production. It is suitable only for experimentation. APIs are subject to change. Documentation is incomplete. And some functionality is experimental.

The big news in Helidon 4.0.0 is the introduction of Helidon Nima -- a ground up webserver implementation based on JDK Project Loom virtual threads. With Helidon 4 you get the high throughput of a reactive server with the simplicity of thread-per-request style programming.

Java 21 is required to use Helidon 4.0.0-M2.

Any easy way to get started with Helidon 4.0.0-M2 is using the helidon CLI

helidon init --version 4.0.0-M2

Notable Changes

* Java 21 is required for 4.0.0-M2
* Finish integration of NÃ­ma WebServer into Helidon 4. This means that the `nima` Java package has been assimilated into the base Helidon packages. 
* Numerous enhancements to WebServer and WebClient to achieve feature parity with Helidon 3

The above is work-in-progress. There are still some gaps, and APIs are subject to change.

## [4.0.0-M1]

This is the first Milestone build of Helidon 4.0.0 and is intended as a preview release only. Do not use this release in production. It is suitable only for experimentation. APIs are subject to change. Documentation is incomplete. And some functionality is experimental and not fully tested.

The big news in Helidon 4.0.0 is the introduction of Helidon Nima -- a [ground up webserver implementation based on JDK Project Loom virtual threads](https://medium.com/helidon/helidon-n%C3%ADma-helidon-on-virtual-threads-130bb2ea2088). 

Java 20 is required to use Heldon 4.0.0-M1.

Any easy way to get started with Helidon 4.0.0-M1 is using the [helidon CLI](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon#helidon-cli)

```
helidon init --version 4.0.0-M1
```

### Notable Changes

- Removed the Helidon Reactive WebServer and WebClient that were based on Netty as we fully commit to new implementations based on virtual threads that have a blocking style API (Project NÃ­ma).
- Converted other modules with reactive APIs to blocking style APIs. The `io.helidon.common.reactive` APIs will stay as general purpose reactive utilities and operators
- Introduced Helidon Injection, a deterministic, source-code-first, compile time injection framework
- Upgraded MicroProfile support to MicroProfile 6 and Jakarta 10 Core Profile running on the NÃ­ma WebServer
- Started adoption of Helidon Builders, a builder code generation framework

The above is work-in-progress. There are still missing features, and APIs are undergoing change. For example
the Grpc implementation is limited and MicroProfile Grpc support is temporarily absent.

## [4.0.0-ALPHA6]

This is the sixth Alpha build of Helidon 4.0.0 and is intended as a preview release only. Do not use this release in production. It is suitable only for experimentation. APIs are subject to change. Documentation is incomplete. And some functionality is experimental and not fully tested.

The big news in Helidon 4.0.0 is the introduction of Helidon Nima -- a [ground up webserver implementation based on JDK Project Loom virtual threads](https://medium.com/helidon/helidon-n%C3%ADma-helidon-on-virtual-threads-130bb2ea2088). Helidon 4.0.0 is a major release that includes significant new features and fixes. As a major release it also includes backward incompatible API changes.

Java 20 or newer is required to use Heldon 4.0.0-ALPHA6.

## [4.0.0-ALPHA4]

This is the fourth Alpha build of Helidon 4.0.0 and is intended as a preview release only. Do not use this release in production. It is suitable only for experimentation. APIs are subject to change. Documentation is incomplete. And some functionality is experimental and not fully tested.

The big news in Helidon 4.0.0 is the introduction of Helidon Nima -- a [ground up webserver implementation based on JDK Project Loom virtual threads](https://medium.com/helidon/helidon-n%C3%ADma-helidon-on-virtual-threads-130bb2ea2088). 

Helidon 4.0.0 is a major release that includes significant new features and fixes. As a major release it also includes some backward incompatible API changes.

Java 19 or newer is required to use Heldon 4.0.0-ALPHA4.

### MicroProfile Support

4.0.0-ALPHA4 now supports MicroProfile 5 running on Nima WebServer. Please give it a try! If you are upgrading an existing Helidon 3.x MicroProfile application and run into an error concerning `io.common.HelidonConsoleHandler` then change `logging.properties` to use `io.helidon.logging.jul.HelidonConsoleHandler` instead.

## [4.0.0-ALPHA1]

We are pleased to announce Helidon 4.0.0-ALPHA1. This is the first Alpha build of Helidon 4.0.0 and is intended as a preview release only. Do not use this release in production. It is suitable only for experimentation. APIs are subject to change. Documentation is incomplete. And some functionality is experimental and not fully tested.

The big news in this build is the introduction of Helidon Nima -- a ground up webserver implementation based on JDK Project Loom. More information to come.

Helidon 4.0.0 is a major release that includes significant new features and fixes. As a major release it also includes some backward incompatible API changes.

### Notable Changes

- Java 19 early access (with Loom support) as the minimal Java version
- Using System.Logger instead of java util logging (incremental change)
- `HelidonServiceLoader` is now part of `helidon-common` module
- Introduction of `@Weight`, `Weighted` and `Weights` instead of `@Priority` and `Prioritized`, to base ordering on a double (allows to fit a component between any other two components), all modules using priority are refactored (except for MicroProfile where required by specifications).
  - higher weight means a component is more important 
  - moved priority related types to MP config (as that is the lowest level MP module)
  - replaces all instances in SE that use priority with weight (no dependency on Jakarta, predictible and easy to understand behavior)
- Introduction of `MediaType` as the abstraction of any media type, as used by Config, static content and HTTP in general. See `MediaType` and `MediaTypes`
- `MapperManager` now supports mapping qualifiers
- new `helidon-common-parameters` module contains an abstraction of a container that has named values (one or more); this is used in path parameters, query parameters, form parameters etc.
- new `helidon-common-uri` module contains URI abstraction (path with possible parameters, query, and fragment)
- Header processing now uses `HeaderName` and `HeaderValue` types. This allows you to prepare constants with custom names and values that
  are often reused. It also allows us to improve parsing speed of HTTP requests.
