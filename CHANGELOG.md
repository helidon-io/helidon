## [2.1.0]

2.1.0 is a minor release of Helidon. It contains bug fixes and enhancements. Notable changes:

- MicroProfile 3.3 support
- New Helidon SE Fault Tolerance implementation. This also replaces Hystrix in the MicroProfile
  Fault Tolerance implementation.

### Compatibility

2.1.0 is API compatible with previous releases of 2.0. There are some minor
behavioral changes:

- Security: To remove accidental propagation of identity, all security providers that support outbound
  security were updated to only do outbound security when configured so. All of these providers
  now have an `outbound` configuration section that can define outbound targets. Documentation of
  providers was updated to match this new approach and is available in both MP and SE docs.
- Custom jlink images produced by the helidon-mave-plugin now have a -jri suffix.
  So the path to start your application looks something like:
  target/helidon-quickstart-se-jri/bin/start

### Backward incompatible changes

#### gRPC: Renamed several annotations and classes

As part of gRPC API cleanup, we have renamed the following annotations and classes:

| Old Name                 | New Name           |
| ------------------------ | ------------------ |
| `@RpcService`            | `@Grpc`            |
| `@RpcMethod`             | `@GrpcMethod`      |
| `@GrpcServiceProxy`      | `@GrpcProxy`       |
| `GrpcClientProxyBuilder` | `GrpcProxyBuilder` |

While in general we prefer not to break backwards compatibility by renaming public API
classes, we felt that in this case the change was warranted and acceptable, for several reasons:

1. gRPC API was marked experimental in Helidon 1.x
2. While using gRPC in our own applications, we have realized that the code in some cases
   does not read as well as it should, and that some class and annotation names should be changed
   to improve both internal API consistency and readability

We apologize for the inconvenience, but we do feel that the impact of the changes is minimal
and that the changes will be beneficial in the long run.     

#### Internal `helidon-common-metrics` and Related Classes Removed
Later releases of Helidon 1.x included the `helidon-common-metrics` component and related
classes which provided a common interface to ease the transition from MicroProfile 
Metrics 1.x to 2.x. 
Although intended for use only by Helidon subsystems rather than 
by developers and users, the component and its contents had to be public so multiple Helidon 
subsystems could use them. 
Therefore, user code might have used these elements.

This release removes this common interface and associated classes. 
Any user code that used these internal classes can use the corresponding supported classes in 
`io.helidon.metrics:helidon-metrics` and MicroProfile Metrics 2.0 instead. 

|Helidon Artifact |Interfaces/Classes |
|--------------|----------------|
|`io.helidon.common:helidon-common-metrics` |Entire artifact, including all `io.helidon.common.metrics...` classes |
|`io.helidon.metrics:helidon-metrics` |`HelidonMetadata` |
| |`InternalBridgeImpl` |
| |`InternalMetadataBuilderImpl` |
| |`InternalMetadataImpl` |
| |`InternalMetricIDImpl` |

## [2.0.0-M3]

### Notes

This is the third milestone release of Helidon 2.0. It contains significant new features,
enhancements and fixes. It also contains backward incompatible changes (see section below).
This milestone release is provided for customers that want early access to Helidon 2.0. It
should be considered unstable and is not intended for production use. APIs and features might
not be fully tested and are subject to change. Documentation is incomplete. Those looking
for a stable release should use a 1.4 release.

#### Thank You!

Thanks to community member David Karnok [akarnokd](https://github.com/akarnokd) for his
significant contributions to our reactive support.

### Backward incompatible changes

#### Removal of processor-like operators
The formerly public `Flow.Processor` implementations performing common operations have been removed. 
Users should use the respective operators from `Single` and `Multi` instead:

```java
// before
Flow.Publisher<Integer> source = ...
MappingProcessor<Integer, String> mapper = new MappingProcessor<>(Integer::toString);
source.subscribe(mapper);
mapper.subscribe(subscriber);

// after
Flow.Publisher<Integer> source = ...
Multi.from(source)
     .map(Integer::toString)
     .subscribe(subscriber)
```

#### Removal of Flows
The class was providing basic `Flow.Publisher` implementations. Users should pick one of the static methods of 
`Single` or `Multi` instead, which provide the additional benefits of having fluent operators available to them for 
assembling reactive flows conveniently:
```java
// before
Flow.Publisher<Integer> just = Flows.singletonPublisher(1);
Flow.Publisher<Object> empty = Flows.emptyPublisher();

// after
Multi<Integer> just1 = Multi.singleton(1);
Single<Integer> just2 = Single.just(1);

Multi<Object> empty1 = Multi.empty();
Single<Object> empty2 = Single.empty();
```

#### MediaSupport refactored
The `MediaSupport` class has been used as holder object of media operator contexts. Now, the name has changed to `MediaContext`, 
and`MediaSupport` will be the name given to the interface which defines media support for given type (readers, writers etc.)  
The Classes `JsonProcessing`, `JsonBinding` and `Jackson` are now renamed to `JsonpSupport`, `JsonbSupport` and `JacksonSupport` 
and are implementing the `MediaSupport` interface.

```java
//before
JsonProcessing jsonProcessing = new JsonProcessing();
MediaSupport mediaSupport = MediaSupport.builder()
    .registerReader(jsonProcessing.newReader())
    .registerWriter(jsonProcessing.newWriter())
    .build();

WebServer.builder()
    .mediaSupport(mediaSupport)
    .build();

#### Thank You!

Thanks to community member David Karnok [akarnokd](https://github.com/akarnokd) for his
significant contributions to our reactive support.

### Backward incompatible changes

#### Resource class when loaded from Config
The configuration approach to `Resource` class was using prefixes which was not aligned with our approach to configuration.
All usages were refactored as follows:

1. The `Resource` class expects a config node `resource` that will be used to read it
2. The feature set remains unchanged - we support path, classpath, url, content as plain text, and content as base64
3. Classes using resources are changed as well, such as `KeyConfig` - see details below

##### OidcConfig
Configuration has been updated to use the new `Resource` approach:

1. `oidc-metadata.resource` is the new key for loading `oidc-metadata` from local resource
2. `sign-jwk.resource` is the new key for loading signing JWK resource

##### JwtProvider and JwtAuthProvider
Configuration has been updated to use the new `Resource` approach:

1. `jwk.resource` is the new key for loading JWK for verifying signatures
2. `jwt.resource` is also used for outbound as key for loading JWK for signing tokens

##### GrpcTlsDescriptor
Configuration has been updated to use the new `Resource` approach:

1. `tls-cert.resource` is the new key for certificate
2. `tls-key.resource` is the new key for private key
3. `tl-ca-cert` is the the new key for certificate 

##### KeyConfig

The configuration has been updated to have a nicer tree structure:

Example of a public key from keystore:
```yaml
ssl:
  keystore:
    cert.alias: "service_cert"
    resource.path: "src/test/resources/keystore/keystore.p12"
    type: "PKCS12"
    passphrase: "password"
```

Example of a private key from keystore:
```yaml
ssl:
  keystore:
    key:
      alias: "myPrivateKey"
      passphrase: "password"
    resource.path: "src/test/resources/keystore/keystore.p12"
    type: "PKCS12"
    passphrase: "password"
```

Example of a pem resource with private key and certificate chain:
```yaml
ssl:
  pem:
    key:
      passphrase: "password"
      resource.resource-path: "keystore/id_rsa.p8"
    cert-chain:
      resource.resource-path: "keystore/public_key_cert.pem"
```

### Backward incompatible changes

In order to stay current with dependencies, and also refine our APIs we have 
introduced some backward incompatible changes in this release. Most of the changes
are mechanical in nature: changing package names, changing GAV coordinates, etc.
Here are the details:

#### Java Runtime

- Java 8 support has been dropped. Java 11 or newer is now required.

#### Common
- Removed `io.helidon.reactive.Flow`, please use `java.util.concurrent.Flow`
- Removed `io.helidon.common.CollectionsHelper`, please use factory methods of `Set`, `Map` and `List`
- Removed `io.helidon.common.OptionalHelper`, please use methods of `java.util.Optional`
- Removed `io.helidon.common.StackWalker`, please use `java.lang.StackWalker`
- Removed `io.helidon.common.InputStreamHelper`, please use `java.io.InputStream` methods
- Removed dependency on Project Reactor

#### Tracing
- We have upgraded to OpenTracing version 0.33.0 that is not backward compatible, the following breaking changes exist
    (these are OpenTracing changes, not Helidon changes):
    1. `TextMapExtractAdapter` and `TextMapInjectAdapter` are now `TextMapAdapter`
    2. module name changed from `opentracing.api` to `io.opentracing.api` (same for `noop` and `util`)
    3. `SpanBuilder` no longer has `startActive` method, you need to use `Tracer.activateSpan(Span)`
    4. `ScopeManager.activate(Span, boolean)` is replaced by `ScopeManager.activate(Span)` - second parameter is now always 
            `false`
    5. `Scope ScopeManager.active()` is removed - replaced by `Span Tracer.activeSpan()`
- If you use the `TracerBuilder` abstraction in Helidon and have no custom Spans, there is no change required    

#### Config

##### Helidon MP
When using MP Config through the API, there are no backward incompatible changes in Helidon.

##### Helidon SE Config Usage

The following changes are relevant when using Helidon Config:

1. File watching is now done through a `ChangeWatcher` - use of `PollingStrategies.watch()` needs to be refactored to
    `FileSystemWatcher.create()` and the method to configure it on config source builder has changed to 
    `changeWatcher(ChangeWatcher)`
2. Methods on `ConfigSources` now return specific builders (they use to return `AbstractParsableConfigSource.Builder` with
    a complex type declaration). If you store such a builder in a variable, either change it to the correct type, or use `var`
3. Some APIs were cleaned up to be aligned with the development guidelines of Helidon. When using Git config source, or etcd
    config source, the factory methods moved to the config source itself, and the builder now accepts all configuration
    options through methods
4. The API of config source builders has been cleaned, so now only methods that are relevant to a specific config source type
    can be invoked on such a builder. Previously you could configure a polling strategy on a source that did not support 
    polling
5. There is a small change in behavior of Helidon Config vs. MicroProfile config: 
    The MP TCK require that system properties are fully mutable (e.g. as soon as the property is changed, it
    must be used), so MP Config methods work in this manner (with a certain performance overhead).
    Helidon Config treats System properties as a mutable config source, with a (optional) time based polling strategy. So
    the change is reflected as well, though not immediately (this is only relevant if you use change notifications). 
6. `CompositeConfigSource` has been removed from `Config`. If you need to configure `MerginStrategy`, you can do it now on 
    `Config` `Builder`

##### Helidon SE Config Extensibility

1. Meta configuration has been refactored to be done through `ServiceLoader` services. If you created
a custom `ConfigSource`, `PollingStrategy` or `RetryPolicy`, please have a look at the new documentation.
2. To implement a custom config source, you need to choose appropriate (new) interface(s) to implement. This is the choice:
    From "how we obtain the source of data" point of view:
    * `ParsableSource` - for sources that provide bytes (used to be reader, now `InputStream`)
    * `NodeConfigSource` - for sources that provide a tree structure directly
    * `LazyConfigSource` - for sources that cannot read the full config tree in advance
    From mutability point of view (immutable config sources can ignore this):
    * `PollableSource` - a config source that is capable of identifying a change based on a data "stamp"
    * `WatchableSource` - a config source using a target that can be watched for changes without polling (such as `Path`)
    * `EventConfigSource` - a config source that can trigger change events on its own 
3. `AbstractConfigSource` and `AbstractConfigSourceBuilder` are now in package `io.helidon.config`
4. `ConfigContext` no longer contains method to obtain a `ConfigParser`, as this is no longer responsibility of 
    a config source
5.  Do not throw an exception when config source does not exist, just return
    an empty `Optional` from `load` method, or `false` from `exists()` method
6.  Overall change support is handled by the config module and is no longer the responsibility
    of the config source, just implement appropriate SPI methods if changes are supported,
    such as `PollableSource.isModified(Object stamp)`
 

#### Metrics
Helidon now supports only MicroProfile Metrics 2.x. Modules for Metrics 1.x were removed, and 
modules for 2.x were renamed from `metrics2` to `metrics`.

#### Security

- When OIDC provider is configured to use cookie (default configuration) to carry authentication information,
    the cookie `Same-Site` is now set to `Lax` (used to be `Strict`). This is to prevent infinite redirects, as 
    browsers would refuse to set the cookie on redirected requests (due to this setting).
    Only in case the frontend host and identity host match, we leave `Strict` as the default


#### Microprofile Bundles
We have removed all versioned MP bundles (i.e. `helidon-microprofile-x.x`, and introduced
unversioned core and full bundles:

- `io.helidon.microprofile.bundles:helidon-microprofile-core` - contains only MP Server
   and Config. Allows you to add only the specifications needed by your application.
- `io.helidon.microprofile.bundles:helidon-microprofile` - contains the latest full 
   MicroProfile version implemented by Helidon
   
You can find more information in this blog post:
[New Maven bundles](https://medium.com/helidon/microprofile-3-2-and-helidon-mp-1-4-new-maven-bundles-a9f2bdc1b5eb)

#### Helidon CDI and MicroProfile Server

- You cannot start CDI container yourself (this change is required so we can 
      support GraalVM `native-image`)
    - You can only run a single instance of Server in a JVM
    - If you use `SeContainerInitializer` you would get an exception
        - this can be worked around by configuration property `mp.initializer.allow=true`, and warning can be removed
            using `mp.initializer.no-warn=true`
        - once `SeContainerInitializer` is used, you can no longer use MP with `native-image` 
- You can no longer provide a `Context` instance, root context is now built-in
- `MpService` and `MpServiceContext` have been removed
    - methods from context have been moved to `JaxRsCdiExtension` and `ServerCdiExtension` that can be accessed
        from CDI extension through `BeanManager.getExtension`.
    - methods `register` can be used on current `io.helidon.context.Context`
    - `MpService` equivalent is a CDI extension. All Helidon services were refactored to CDI extension 
        (you can use these for reference)
- `Server.cdiContainer` is removed, use `CDI.current()` instead

#### Startup
New recommended option to start Helidon MP:
1. Use class `io.helidon.microprofile.cdi.Main`
2. Use meta configuration option when advanced configuration of config is required (e.g. `meta-config.yaml`)
3. Put `logging.properties` on the classpath or in the current directory to be automatically picked up to configure 
    Java util logging
    
`io.helidon.microprofile.server.Main` is still available, just calls `io.helidon.microprofile.cdi.Main` and is deprecated.
`io.helidon.microprofile.server.Server` is still available, though the features are much reduced


#### MicroProfile JWT-Auth
If a JAX-RS application exists that is annotated with `@LoginConfig` with value `MP-JWT`, the correct authentication
provider is added to security.
The startup would fail if the provider is required yet not configured.

#### Security in MP
If there is no authentication provider configured, authentication will always fail.
If there is no authorization provider configured, ABAC provider will be configured.
(original behavior - these were configured if there was no provider configured overall) 

### Other Behavior changes

- JAX-RS applications now work similar to how they work in application servers
    - if there is an `Application` subclass that returns anything from
      `getClasses` or `getSingletons`, it is used as is
    - if there is an `Application` subclass that returns empty sets from these methods,
      all available resource classes will be part of such an application
    - if there is no `Application` subclass, a synthetic application will be
      created with all available resource classes
    - `Application` subclasses MUST be annotated with `@ApplicationScoped`,
      otherwise they are ignored
