## [1.3.0] 

### Notes

This release is a feature release and adds support for MicroProfile 3.0 and
support for Hibernate as a JPA provider. It also includes a number of additional
bug fixes and enhancements.

**Note:** MicroProfile 3.0 breaks compatibility with MicroProfile 2.2 -- specifically
in the area of Metrics. Since Helidon 1.3 continues to support MicroProfile 2.2
your applications that depend on the MicroProfile 2.2 APIs should continue to work
when you upgrade to Helidon 1.3. But when you switch to MicroProfile 3.0 you will
likely need to change code that uses the MicroProfile Metrics API. For more
information see sections 6.5 and Chapter 7 of
[microprofile-metrics-spec-2.0.pdf](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/releases/download/2.0/microprofile-metrics-spec-2.0.pdf)

As part of this release we are also deprecating APIs for possible removal
in a future release. Please see the Deprecations section below.

- All methods that provide general health checks and not readiness or liveness checks. For example
  use `HealthSupportBuilder.addLiveness()` instead of `HealthSupportBuilder.add()`
- `io.helidon.common.reactive.SubmissionPublisher`
- The `io.helidon.service.configuration` package.
- The `io.helidon.common.reactive.valve` package.
- Any other classes and methods that have been annotated as deprecated.

## [1.0.0] - 2019-02-12

### Notes

This is our 1.0 release and we have finished the API changes that we've
been working on over the last few months. From this point on we will
have much greater API stability. Thanks for your patience.

If you are upgrading from 0.11.0 note that media support (for example JsonSupport)
has moved to a top level `media` component. This means you might have to change
your dependencies and Java imports. For more details see:
[API Changes](https://github.com/oracle/helidon/wiki/API-Changes-in-1.0). 

If you are upgrading from 0.10.5 or earlier you will need to change
your application due to a number of API changes we made in preperation
for 1.0. For details on API changes see:
[API Changes](https://github.com/oracle/helidon/wiki/API-Changes-in-1.0)

Helidon 1.0 supports [MicroProfile 1.2](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-bom/releases/download/1.2/microprofile-spec-1.2.pdf)
with updated versions of the components.

### Improvements

- WebServer: Add JSON-B (Yasson) support [388](https://github.com/oracle/helidon/pull/388)

- MicroProfile: update Hystrix to 1.5.18 [391](https://github.com/oracle/helidon/pull/391)
- Examples: Change quickstart examples so that PUT uses json and not path param [399](https://github.com/oracle/helidon/pull/399)

### Fixes

- WebServer: Fix for NullPointer when using Json support without configured charset [393](https://github.com/oracle/helidon/pull/393)

## [0.11.1] - 2019-02-07

### Notes

If you are upgrading from 0.10.5 or earlier you will need to change
your application (see Notes for 0.11.0 release). For details on API
changes see [API Changes](https://github.com/oracle/helidon/wiki/API-Changes-in-1.0)

If you are upgrading from 0.11.0 note that media support (for example JsonSupport)
has moved to a top level `media` component. Details
in [API Changes](https://github.com/oracle/helidon/wiki/API-Changes-in-1.0). 

Thanks for your patience with API changes. Once 1.0 is released this will
be behind us!
