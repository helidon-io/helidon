## [4.0.0-ALPHA-1]

We are pleased to announce Helidon 4.0.0 a major release that includes significant new features and fixes. As a major release it also includes some backward incompatible API changes.

### Notable Changes

- Java 19 early access (with Loom support) as the minimal Java version
- Using System.Logger instead of java util logging (incremental change)
- `HelidonServiceLoader` is now part of `helidon-common` module
- Introduction of `@Weight`, `Weighted` and `Weights` instead of `@Priority` and `Prioritized`, to base ordering on a double (allows to fit a component between any other two components), all modules using priority are refactored (except for MicroProfile where required by specifications).
  - higher weight means a component is more important 
  - moved priority related types to MP config (as that is the lowest level MP module)
  - replaces all instances in SE that use priority with weight (no dependency on Jakarta, predictible and easy to understand behavior)
- Introduction of `MediaType` as the abstraction of any media type, as used by Config, static content and HTTP in general. See `MediaType` and `MediaTypes`
- `MapperManager` now supports mapping qualifiers
- new `helidon-common-parameters` module contains an abstraction of a container that has named values (one or more); this is used in path parameters, query parameters, form parameters etc.
- new `helidon-common-uri` module contains URI abstraction (path with possible parameters, query, and fragment)
- Header processing now uses `HeaderName` and `HeaderValue` types. This allows you to prepare constants with custom names and values that
  are often reused. It also allows us to improve parsing speed of HTTP requests.
